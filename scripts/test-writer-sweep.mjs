// (macOS/BSD ssh hosts), and r4 changed it — it flattens the `ps` blob with
// `tr '\n' ' '` first, "the way the JS twin's /\s+/ split always did". That
// sentence was a DESCRIPTION: the branch had no assertion of its own and no
// control, on this Linux box every fixture takes the /proc rung, and the one
// leg that reaches the branch at all (the vanished-pid stderr leg in §1) only
// looks at stderr. So the half of the r4 fix that lives here shipped unproven —
// (r) again: a branch no test can reach is a branch that drifts.
//
// Reaching it needs TWO environment substitutions and NO edit to the text under
// test: (a) re-root `/proc/$1/` so BOTH reads miss, which is exactly what
// "there is no /proc here" means (r3's re-root technique, widened from the
// cmdline literal to the exe one — leaving the exe read live let rung 3 answer
// from `/proc/<pid>/exe` and the ps rung was never the decider); (b) a `ps` on
// PATH that does NOT flatten a newline inside an argv word. (b) is a stand-in
// on purpose and the assertion says so: measured here, procps 4.x `ps -o args=`
// RENDERS an embedded newline as a space, so this box's own `ps` cannot produce
// the multi-line blob the fix is about — and the branch only ever runs on a
// platform whose `ps` this box does not have. The stand-in reads the REAL argv
// out of /proc and joins the words with single spaces, so the only thing it
// invents is the one byte the local `ps` refuses to emit.
//
// The invariant under test is PARITY OF THE SAME RUNG: the shell's ps fallback
// and the JS twin's ps fallback see the identical lossy blob (`ps` cannot
// recover word boundaries — both spellings answer `claude` for fixture A, which
// the /proc rung calls `tail`; that is a property of `ps`, not a defect), and
// they must read it the same way. And the JS side is DRIVEN, not mirrored: a
// child node process with a preload that makes the two /proc reads throw runs

// ── 17. THE SIGNAL VERDICT UNDER BUSYBOX (r6, found by review). §16 fixed the
// existence probe on ONE kill path and ENUMERATED the other —
// `src/server/sysinfo-wiring.js signalProc`, the sidebar process manager's
// Terminate — leaving its `ps -p` alive on a hand-written reason: "there it
// sits on the FAILURE branch of a kill that was already ATTEMPTED, so it can
// only mislabel EPERM as ESRCH, never manufacture a success."
//
// That script has TWO `ps -p` calls and the reason was only true of the
// second. The FIRST is the post-signal aliveness check on the SUCCESS branch,
// and there a busybox-blind probe manufactures exactly the outcome §16 exists
// to stop: `kill -TERM` succeeds, `ps -p` cannot answer, so the script says
// OK-GONE and signalProc returns `{ok:true, gone:true}` — the row flips to
// gone while the process runs on. Measured below on a live process with
// `trap "" TERM`, plus the failure branch's mislabel on a real foreign pid.
//
// THE FIX IS NOT A SECOND CORRECT REASON, IT IS ONE PROBE: `vs_alive` moved to
// src/cli-identity.js and BOTH scripts embed it, so there is no per-site
// judgement left to make — and §17f sweeps the tree so a THIRD site cannot
