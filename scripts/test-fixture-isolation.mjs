// THE STANDING SWEEP: no suite's synthetic transcript may live in the REAL
// ~/.claude/projects (2026-09-09).
//
// WHY. Two of the three synthetic-transcript suites spawned the worktree server
// with the INHERITED HOME and wrote their fixture into the developer's own
// `~/.claude/projects`, because the server can only discover a transcript that
// lives under the home it is running with. The machine's PRODUCTION VibeSpace
// instance polls that directory: it listed the fixture as a stopped
// "conversation", and its usage walk ingested every hand-written `usage` block
// into the permanent ledger. MEASURED on the author's instance:
//   · 79,533 ledger rows for the two synthetic session ids, claiming 982,140
//     tokens of `claude-fable-5` that were never spent
//   · 222 permanently dead cursor entries in data/usage-history/_cursors.json
//   · `acct: null` on every row ⇒ attributed to the machine login `__global__`
//     and counted into the `costSince` of its anchor pairs — i.e. into the
//     learned burn rate the quota estimator spends against.
// The owner saw a Fable conversation, and Fable usage, that never happened.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE IS. The suites now isolate HOME and the production readers
// skip the convention, but neither is a MEASUREMENT. This is: it runs the PURE
// rule (src/fixture-guard.js `fixtureLitter`) over the real projects directory
// and goes red when a fixture entry is there. It PRINTS the rule, because a
// sweep whose rule lives only in its assert message teaches nobody what to do
// when it is red.
//
// SCOPE, STATED. It is a FAST-tier suite placed LAST in the table, so within
// the fast tier it truly runs after every suite that could litter. The heavy
// tier is detached and runs later — a heavy-tier leak is caught by the NEXT
// push's fast tier, not by this run. Naming that boundary is cheaper than
// pretending it does not exist.

  //      one suite that genuinely writes under the real home spelled it
  //      `process.env.HOME || os.homedir()` and the census printed a clean
  //      sheet while missing its only true subject.
  //   ② the TARGET spelling (this round). The write's first argument had to BE
  //      the bound name or `path.join(<bound name>, …)`, so ONE hop of
  //      aliasing defeated it: test-chat-e2e.mjs does
  //      `const p = path.join(REAL_PROJECTS, d.name)` and then `fs.rmSync(p)` —
  //      an `rm -rf` under the developer's real home that the census could not
  //      see, while the assert below said "no suite writes under the REAL
  //      ~/.claude". MEASURED before the fix: bound names ["REAL_PROJECTS"],

  // count: it takes the FIXPOINT of "a name derived from a name already known

  // call's FIRST ARGUMENT mentions such a name at all rather than whether it is
  // spelled one of two ways. Deliberately over-inclusive, and the cost was
