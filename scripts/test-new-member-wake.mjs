// The owner added a subscription in the middle of a full-pool exhaustion. The
// pool moved eight fable conversations onto it while it had NO reading at all,
// auto-resume re-armed them for a reset EIGHT HOURS away, the auto-cli panel
// read failed (doubling its backoff — the next read was 13 minutes later), the
// owner clicked ⟳ by hand and that route wrote a reading and told the pool
// NOTHING, and the conversations were released only when he typed a prompt.
//
// THE POOL NEVER GOT TO DECIDE. It re-evaluates on turn ends and on streamed
// usage records, and a conversation that is ARMED produces neither. Two edges
// make a member's first usable reading exist — a login succeeding, and a human
// ⟳ — and neither re-drove anything.
//
// This suite drives the REAL engine + REAL AccountManager pool with real
// per-session symlinks + REAL auto-resume + the real rejection producer, and
// the real account-usage-routes factory for the login exits.
//
// THE NEGATIVE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT:
//   §1b  master reproduced — the credentials land, three ticks pass, the
//        conversation is still waiting for the far reset. Then ONE call to the
//        edge continues it.
//   §1c  each half of the wake switched off ON ITS OWN, through a real
//        production state (a pool with auto:false / an auto-resume that
//        publishes no fireNow), because a wake has two halves and the incident
//        was the second one.
//   §2   the edge refuses: no reading, a stale reading, a reading whose weekly
//        window is another member's, a member that is itself still spent.
//   §3   both floors, and the fingerprint gate on the polled routes.
//   §4   the loop breaker still holds against a member that keeps rejecting.
//   §8   (r2) the three real shapes in which the pool CANNOT move a
//        conversation onto the newcomer — a MANUAL pool, a REMOTE conversation
//        and a COLD one — where round 1 spent a turn on the member the
//        conversation was already stuck on and called it "recovered"; the
//        controls are PATCHED COPIES of the real engine, hit-count asserted.
//        (r3) §8c′ adds the fourth: a CODEX pool carrying `hot:true`, where
//        round 2's gate read the raw flag instead of the caps-gated verdict the
//        engine acts on, so the capability gate delivered the spend the
//        pool-level path had just refused.
//   §9   (r3) the panel refresher's own belt: a `claude -p /usage` that answers
//        after its account was removed writes no cache file and no window
//        sidecar — driven through the real setupUsage factory with a FAKE
//        `claude` on CLAUDE_CMD, so it costs nothing and still exercises the
//        real execFile → parse → write path.

// anyway, so in every shape where the pool structurally CANNOT move a
// conversation onto the newcomer the continue was billed to the member that
// conversation was already stuck on — and the card called THAT member

// POOLED scope with "any member usable", which is true and beside the point.

//   host:'…'     a REMOTE conversation — the per-session pass skips it BY DESIGN
//   hot:false    a COLD pool — it RESTARTS the conversation through the client
//

// replacement asserted to have HIT), because "0 continues delivered" is also

// leaves a cache file AND a window sidecar keyed to an id that names nothing.
