// MUTATION BATTERY FOR THE RELEASE GATE (2026-09-07, B-4c5a) — the evidence
// behind "every new guard has an assert that dies with it". For each guard it
// removes that guard from the REAL product file, runs the suite that is
// supposed to be holding it, and requires RED. Not a test suite (it edits the
// product and takes minutes), so it is deliberately NOT scripts/test-*.mjs and
// the census never sees it; run it by hand after touching ci.mjs or the hook:
//
//     node scripts/dbg-ci-mutations.mjs        # exits 1 if any guard is unheld
//     node scripts/dbg-ci-mutations.mjs '--only=round 4' # just those mutations
//     node scripts/dbg-ci-mutations.mjs --reap-only      # just clear the litter
//
// IT EDITS THE PRODUCT, SO IT OBEYS INVARIANT ⑳. Signal handlers are NOT
// enough and it is worth being precise about why: this script spends ~all of
// its wall time inside `spawnSync`, so a SIGTERM sits queued behind the child
// and a SIGKILL (or a timeout, or a harness whose session dies) runs nothing at
// all. Measured twice: once it stranded the pre-push hook, once it stranded
// `killedFromOutside = () => false` in scripts/ci.mjs — a gate with its own
// abort evidence disabled, sitting in the working tree of the branch shipping
// the gate. So the real protection is a SELF-HEAL at start, out of a SIDECAR
// (TMPDIR/vs-ci-mutations-backup-<uid>.json) holding the exact pre-mutation
// bytes, written before the first mutation and removed on a clean finish.
//
// The sidecar, not `git show HEAD:<path>`, for two reasons that are the whole
// point: (1) these files are usually being WORKED on — HEAD's copy would throw
// away the very edit the battery is being run to check; (2) a mutation can be a
// DELETION (`to: ''`), which leaves no fingerprint to recognise, so "does it
// carry a mutant's replacement text" can never see it. The sidecar makes the
// test exact instead of heuristic: a file is healed only when it is byte-equal
// to `backup.replace(from, to)` for one of the mutations — that is a file this
// tool mutated and did not restore, and nothing else can look like it.
// (The other half of the containment is the gate itself: a dirty tree earns no
// `.git/ci-green` and `--heavy` refuses a verdict at t=0.)
