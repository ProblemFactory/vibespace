// Per-PROCESS scratch paths + free ports for the suites that spawn a throwaway
// server / headless chrome / git worktree (2.369.76). Fixed `/tmp/vs-<name>`
// paths and fixed ports were a MACHINE-wide collision: the heavy tier, a
// verifier agent running the same gate suite in its own worktree, and a
// developer's local run all shared `/tmp/vs-chatpage-smoke`, the chrome
// profile dir and port 3990 — one run's cleanup `git worktree remove --force`
// deleted another run's worktree mid-build (heavy tier RED at 40ad936d on
// test-chat-paging: esbuild lost its input, the retry's `worktree add` hit the
// path the other run had just recreated). 2.369.46 fixed ONE instance
// (test-chat-e2e's port 3995) inline; this is the third strike, so the idiom is
// shared and test-architecture sweeps every scripts/test-*.mjs for the fixed
// shapes. NOT a test-*.mjs on purpose: the tier census would demand a tier.
//
// SINCE 2026-09-09 the prefix and the tmp root are NOT literals here: they come
// from src/fixture-guard.js, the ONE declaration of what a fixture looks like.
// The production usage walk and session discovery skip exactly what this
// function mints, and the standing sweep (scripts/test-fixture-isolation.mjs)
// checks the real ~/.claude/projects for exactly what this function mints — so
// a suite that renames its scratch dir cannot walk out from under the guard.
