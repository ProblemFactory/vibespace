# Account hardening: one identity, one write path, one spend ceiling

**Status**: DESIGN — owner decisions pending (§6), **except the P4 SPEND HALF, which shipped 2026-09-08**
(the pieces that do not depend on the lease or the write-path phases): the spend authorizer + persisted
per-identity budget (§4.4c, D6's numbers as settings), overage gating (D3b, plus D3c behind a default-off
setting), the EDF reserve floor (D2), the Stop nudge's persisted cooldown + exit condition (D8), both money
gates failing closed (§1.4), the widened session-schema detector (§4.4f) and `test-spend-paths` (§3 P9).
Everything else here — the lease, `identityOf`, the single write path, the turn-boundary rule, the rebind
executor, the reconciler and the re-runnable repair — is still unbuilt, and P4's own `usage-reconcile` and
repair halves with it. See docs/kb-bugfix-invariants.md, "THE CEILING ON EVERY TURN NOBODY TYPED", for what
was measured and what the shipped ceiling does NOT do.
**Motivation**: five money-relevant incidents shipped fixes on top of each other in three days
(2026-09-05 → 2026-09-08), the fifth arriving **94 seconds after the fully-fixed build booted**.
**Companions**: docs/design-wall-machine.md (the turn-granular wall state machine this builds on),
docs/design-three-tier.md (the tier rules every change below is routed by), CLAUDE.md's
Pool/billing routing row (the auto-loaded law whose reasoning this document replaces).

Members are anonymised **A–G** throughout; this repository is public and carries no account ids,
org identifiers or addresses. Every figure below was re-measured on this instance while writing
this document unless marked *(audit)*.

## 1. The money-loss catalogue

### 1.1 The five incidents

| # | What happened | Measured cost / blast radius |
|---|---|---|
| I1 | Auto-resume fired **130 billed "continue" turns** into a rate-limit wall (a sibling session, 32). Rejections were attributed to the OTel-observed *spawn* org, so the pool "switched" to the member it was already on and fired again. | ~150 junk cards in one conversation; 1164 same-target re-points on 09-07, **983 of them in one hour** *(audit)* |
| I2 | Quota **readings** were keyed by the spawn org too, so every value a session produced after a hot switch was filed under the account it started on. | **464 foreign anchors** on this instance (§1.2), poisoning the learned burn rates |
| I3 | A login session expires on an **absolute deadline the CLI cannot extend**; nobody was told, and the pool kept choosing dead logins. | Turns failing on a member a 30-second re-login would have fixed |
| I4 | Re-logged-in accounts did not clear their filed warnings. | Red chips + urgent inbox items about accounts that were already healthy |
| I5 | `inc-mts8a8mr-ulmm`: after a re-point, in-flight responses (old token) were filed on the **new** slot ⇒ a 13% account displayed 93% ⇒ **two false fleet switches in 100 seconds**. | 4,446,523 excess cache-write tokens in 8 min ≈ **$89 API-equivalent** *(audit)*; one 950k-token conversation re-wrote its cache 4× in 6.5 min |

Alongside them, the EDF strategy drove one member from **60% → 95% of its weekly window in
12.4 hours** *(audit)* — not a defect, but the policy operating with no floor in exactly the band
where its inputs are least trustworthy.

### 1.2 The contamination, re-measured

Each claude subscription's weekly window is a fixed weekly cadence, so `sevenDay.resetsAt mod
604800` is a per-account **phase fingerprint**, stable to ±60s (the API reports the boundary as
either `:00` or `:00−60s`). Clustering every anchor stream on this instance by that phase:

| stream | windowed anchors | phase clusters | foreign |
|---|---|---|---|
| member A | 1359 | 5 | **274 (20.2%)** |
| member B | 1157 | 5 | **183 (15.8%)** |
| member C | 976 | 3 | 5 |
| member D | 944 | 2 | 1 |
| member E | 333 | 2 | 1 |
| members F, G (small streams) | 25 | 1 each | 0 |
| **claude total** | **4799** | — | **464** |
| codex | 1532 | **53** | n/a — see below |

Three facts this table carries, all load-bearing for §4:

1. **The signal is clean.** Four of the six real streams show 0–5 outliers; the two the pool
   actually rotates between show 20.2% and 15.8%. This is a guard that fires on real damage, not
   on noise.
2. **The foreign values are other members'.** 30 of 41 contiguous foreign runs match, to the
   second, a `resetsAt` present in the true owner's own stream within ±1h *(audit)*. The longest
   run is **15.3 hours / 71 consecutive readings** — this is not a mid-turn race, it is a
   sustained mis-binding.
3. **It is claude-only.** Codex's window is `now + window_minutes` (rolling), giving **53
   clusters** — there is no fingerprint to check. Any design that leans on this check alone
   protects one backend and silently protects none of the others.

### 1.3 The repair that repaired nothing

`data/migrations.json` records `2026-09-reattribute-readings-by-slot` applied at
2026-09-08T05:05:45Z. Its entire output:

```
data/archive/readings-foreign-anchors.ndjson:     1 row
data/archive/readings-foreign-usage-cache.ndjson: 1 row
data/archive/readings-foreign-rates.ndjson:       1 row
```

Against the 464 above, and against its own pre-ship dry run on a copy of these stores (3 caches /
248 anchors / 44 attribution rows). The cause is structural: its only accepted proof is a **wiped
credential file's mtime**, and the I3/I4 fix had just told the owner to re-log those members in,
overwriting it. It then dropped `rates.json` so the estimator re-learned **from the still-poisoned
set**, fired a success notice, and marked itself applied forever (`run-at-most-once`).

### 1.4 Money that leaks with no incident attached

| Leak | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Overage is captured and discarded.** `cache.overage` is written (`src/rate-limit-capture.js:131`) and read by **nobody**; claude's `spend {used,limit,pct}` and codex's `spendControlReached` (`src/harnesses/codex-quota.js:75`) likewise have zero consumers. `accountRemaining()` sees only `utilization`, so an account past its allowance and billing pay-per-use ranks as the member with the **most** remaining. | grep: 0 readers | **CLOSED 2026-09-09** — and the verdict now names EVERY field it claims, per field, because r3 marked this row closed while the third one still had zero readers (`grep -rn spendControlReached src/` returned only its writer, and the record is what the next round reads): `cache.overage` + `cache.spend` → PURE `overageState`, asked by the authorizer (`overage-in-use`), the pool's voluntary-target rule (`overageMemberIds`, behind D3c's `pool.avoidOverageMembers`) and BOTH panels; `cache.spendControlReached` → PURE `spendControlState`, asked by the authorizer (`spend-control-reached` — the `identity-cannot-serve` class, not the money one: codex REJECTS those requests rather than billing them, so `spend.allowOverageTurns` deliberately does not unlock it) and BOTH panels, and deliberately **not** wired into `overageMemberIds`, whose setting names overage and whose bar is about spending money. `test-spend-paths` §7b walks this row's fields and fails on any with no PURE reader, with a control that shows r3's state going red |
| **Seven producers can start a billed turn with no per-occurrence owner action**; only auto-resume consults quota, and `src/server/conversation-deliver.js` consults nothing at all — not quota, not login, not the pool's blocked state. | *(audit)* census; re-derived by `test-spend-paths` §2 from `git ls-files` and PRINTED | **CLOSED 2026-09-08**: all of them pass one authorizer; the census fails an unwired producer — **per SITE since 2026-09-09**, because a per-FILE verdict let a new producer inherit the answer of the gated file it was added to (reproduced). **r5**: passing the authorizer was not enough for the one producer that AWAITS between the gate and the charge — the ladder's ceiling was bypassed by its own in-flight concurrency (5 delivered against a cap of 2, measured) until an authorization started HOLDING what it authorized |
| **The Stop bookkeeping nudge** forces an extra frontier-model turn per stop. | 526 forced turns / 311M cache-read tokens across 7 conversations in 3 days *(audit)*; its only rate limiter is `s._lastStopNudge` — **0 occurrences in `src/session-schema.js`**, so it is not persisted and resets on every release restart | **CLOSED 2026-09-08** (D8): persisted in the guard's store + an exit condition + the ceiling. Re-measured over the WHOLE corpus (a `-mtime -3` sample selects FILES, not records): 603 nudges / 72 conversations / two months, 999 forced assistant records, 536M cache-read tokens, peaks 93 a day and 21 on one conversation in one hour |
| **The money gate fails open at every layer it has**: `usage-pool-engine.js:1331` `catch { return true; }`, the wiring at `server.js:1491`, and — found 2026-09-09, because the first two were verified by GREP — `auto-resume.js`'s own `catch { gate = true; }` + `.catch(() => deliver())`. | verified; the third measured on the real module (throw ⇒ 1 billed continue, rejected promise ⇒ 1) | **CLOSED 2026-09-08 / 2026-09-09**: all three fail closed, each with a named reason + `spend-gate-error` telemetry; `test-spend-paths` §9 DRIVES auto-resume's layer (four arms, negative control = a patched copy of the real module with master's two shapes restored) and reads the other two on the gate's own body (the fix's comment quotes the retired shape, so comments are stripped first) |
| **The dwell belt is exempted by an estimate.** Both belts skip when `d.fromRemaining < POOL_HARD_PCT`, and `fromRemaining` arrives through `estOverlayCache`. In I5's second cascade the raw cache returned `hold` at 6%; only the overlay's last point produced `4.97%`, which both tripped exhaustion **and** released the brake that exists to contain bad switches. | verified at `:1920`, `:1985` | unaddressed |
| **Provenance reaches one panel of four.** `src/lib/usage-source.js` is imported by `src/lib/usage-meter.js` only. Manage Agents — where the owner picks a switch target and decides which login to fix — renders the same donuts with no source, no corroboration, no stale-login warning. | grep: 1 importer | unaddressed |
| **A producer we ship has no name.** `src/usage-routes.js:611,625` writes `source: 'on-demand-remote'`, absent from `usage-source.js`'s table ⇒ every manually-refreshed remote row renders *"Unrecognised reading source — reported verbatim"* about our own writer. | verified | unaddressed |

---

## 2. Root-cause thesis

> **The system MUTATES the binding between a running CLI process and a credential directory, then
> spends money on INFERENCES about what that binding currently is.**

`repointPoolSymlink` (`src/account-material.js`) renames a symlink and bumps the target credential
file's mtime so the CLI re-reads it *on a schedule we do not control*. The fact "which account is
this conversation billing" is therefore unobservable, and four rival derivations grew for it:

| derivation | evidence | lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| `accounts.poolCurrentFor` | readlink | **per call** |
| `observedMemberFor` (OTel) | the org the CLI cached at **spawn** | per record |
| `readingSlotFor` / `rejectionSlotFor` | readlink, **pinned to the turn** | per turn |
| `data/bin/vibespace-usage` | readlink + a `.slot-<sid>` payload fingerprint | one-request lag |

Each of the five fixes taught **one pair** of these to agree. The pairs nobody re-derived kept
diverging — which is exactly why five fixes produced a sixth incident. And one derivation was
never fixed at all:

> **`resolveUsageKey` (`usage-pool-engine.js:489`) resolves COST per RECORD.**
> Its three `noteLive` producers (`claude-stream-json.js:633`, `session-brain.js:95`,
> `usage-pool-engine.js:1647`) each call `kickPoolEval()` on the **next line** — so the producer
> that files record *N* is the thing that moves the link before record *N+1*. That ring feeds
> `_liveDelta` → `_costFn` → `learnRates` → `_persistRates`, i.e. a turn spanning a re-point
> poisons **persisted** `rates.json` for the member that did not spend it.

So within one turn today, a session files its *utilization* on the pinned member and its *dollars*
on whatever the link says at that instant. Readings were pinned for exactly this reason; cost was
not, and nobody noticed there was a third thing to fix.

**The fix is not a sixth pin.** It is to make the answer a durable OBJECT that cannot change under
a running turn — and, because an object can still be wrong (a device sealed-order, a hand edit, a
skewed producer), to give every reading a way to REFUTE its own attribution, and every unattended
turn one ceiling it cannot spend past.

## 3. Principles (each is an enforceable invariant)

Every principle names the test that makes it red. A principle with no test is a comment.

| # | Invariant | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **One question, one function, one lifetime.** `identityOf(session, at)` is the only thing in the tree that answers session→account — for readings, rejections, cost, fire targets, the ledger and the UI badge alike. | `test-architecture` **derivation census**: any `poolCurrentFor` / pool-link `readlinkSync` / money-path `organization.id` read outside `src/leases.js` + `src/accounts.js` fails the BUILD. File set derived from `git ls-files`, walked set PRINTED. |
| **P2** | **The answer is a RECORD, not a syscall.** A lease is written once with its `from`, so every late question is a lookup, never an inference. | `test-lease-identity`: `identityOf(s, t)` for a past `t` equals the lease that was open at `t`, across a restart. |
| **P3** | **Identity is per PROCESS, not per moment.** A lease opens at spawn and moves only at a **turn boundary**. | `test-turn-boundary-switch`: a re-point attempted mid-turn is queued, not applied; negative control = today's path, which must reproduce I5. |
| **P4** | **One write path.** `src/usage-cache-write.js` is the only way a usage-cache odometer may move. | `test-usage-write-path`: **grep-derived** writer census (over-inclusive by design), prints its set, fails on any bypass. Dead allowlist entries also fail. |
| **P5** | **Every payload must be able to refute its own attribution — and a harness must DECLARE whether it can.** A weekly phase that contradicts a live one is disputed. Codex has no fingerprint and must say so. | `backend-caps` row `quotaWindowFingerprint: 'weekly-phase' \| null` + `test-harness-contract`: no harness may claim a fingerprint the wire does not produce. |
| **P6** | **Ignorance is never a claim.** No prior window = TOFU; unreadable credential file = UNKNOWN. Neither blocks. Only a *contradiction* disputes. | `test-credential-state`: a stat-succeeds-read-fails file must NOT hard-exclude a member; negative control = today's fold, which excludes it and memoizes the exclusion on an mtime that then never changes. |
| **P7** | **An ESTIMATE may never authorize an irreversible act.** It may narrow a choice; it may not trip exhaustion alone, exempt the dwell belt, or open a spend gate. | `test-pool-cascade`: replay I5's timeline; an overlay-derived `fromRemaining` must not bypass the 180s belt. |
| **P8** | **Money gates fail CLOSED, at every layer, and the refusal reaches the user.** *"Every layer" has to be VERIFIED at that layer: 2026-09-09 found a third one (auto-resume's own `beforeFire` handling) still failing open after the two the §1.4 row named had been fixed — and fixed by grep, which is why nothing was red.* | `test-spend-paths` §9: a throwing `beforeFire` and a rejecting one each deliver **zero** continues while `false`/`true` are the reachability controls; negative control = a patched copy of the real module with the pre-fix shapes restored (each substitution asserted to have landed), which delivers one billed continue per broken gate. The other two layers are source pins, and the suite says which claim is a measurement and which is a read. |
| **P9** | **One ceiling, on the IDENTITY.** Every unattended billed turn passes one authorizer with a persisted per-identity budget — **and every knob that bounds it is REACHABLE** (2026-09-09: all seven `Spending` settings were grouped into a bucket `SettingsUI` never renders, so the ceiling shipped with no way to change it and three shipped strings pointed the user at a panel section that could not open) — **and the turn is CHARGED to the identity it was AUTHORIZED against** (2026-09-09 r4: the ladder resolved the slot at the gate, threw the answer away and handed `note()` a bare session, so the guard re-ran `identityOf` at CHARGE time — across a window the rpc rung widens to 120 s and the pool's own 30 s timer moves. A ceiling charged to somebody else is not a ceiling: measured on the real guard + real ladder at a 1/hour cap, **three deliveries authorized against a cap of one**, the authorized account debited 0 and an account nobody asked debited three, where it then refuses its own legitimate unattended turns) — **and an AUTHORIZATION BINDS THE CEILING UNTIL SOMEBODY SAYS WHAT HAPPENED** (2026-09-09 r5: the two phases are not one instant, so five deliveries dispatched in one synchronous pass — the shape `src/jobs.js` produces, since `_notifyRate` is keyed per conversation — all read the same pre-charge counts and spent **5 turns against a cap of 2**; a hold now binds like a charge until it is converted, given back or expires) — **and the ledger it counts must be loaded with limits somebody can answer** (r5: the guard is constructed 318 lines before `setupPersistence()` assigns `readSettings`, so the boot prune used the DEFAULT retention and forgave up to `cap − 264` unattended turns on every restart). | `test-spend-paths`: grep-derived census of everything that can cause an unattended turn, **per SITE since r3** (a per-FILE verdict let a new producer inherit a gated file's answer — reproduced); an unwired site is red. `test-architecture` §44: every `schema.category` reaches a rendered section, in the BUILD. **§5c (r4)** drives all four producers and asserts the ledger names the AUTHORIZED slot, with a patched copy of the real ladder carrying r3's shipped line as its negative control; the guard's `chargesUnhinted` counter makes the same rule observable in production, so it is not a grep. **§5d/§5e (r5)** drive five concurrent deliveries on one credential slot (sequential on an identical world is the positive control; a patched guard with the reservation removed is the negative one), the pre-gate PROBE that must not hold, and the withheld steer's three settlements; **§3d (r5)** pins the production boot ORDERING on the real files and then drives the real ledger through it, with the pre-fix prune as its negative control. `holdsOpen`/`holdsExpired` are the production census for a hold nobody converted or released. |
| **P10** | **Evidence must not be destroyed by our own mechanism.** Nothing may rewrite a credential file's mtime as a side effect; identity keys are MINTED, never scraped from mutable content. | `test-account-pool`: after a lease move the target's credential mtime is unchanged; `test-usage-anchors`: an account's stream key survives a cache write that drops `orgUuid`. |
| **P11** | **A repair whose evidence can improve must not be run-at-most-once.** | `test-migrations`: the readings repair is content-keyed and idempotent across two runs with new rows in between. |
| **P12** | **Fixtures must be able to express the failure.** Every member in a money fixture gets a DISTINCT weekly window, and no assertion may pin a particular attribution ANSWER — only the SHAPE. Every negative control is a **patched copy of the real module** with an assertion that the patch was applied. | `test-readings-attribution`, `test-pool-auto`: today `R5`/`R7` are module constants shared by every member *and* every synthetic reading (`:88`), and `acct()` hard-wires `scopedWeekly.resetsAt === sevenDay.resetsAt` (`:29`) — the defect is literally unrepresentable. |

## 4. Target architecture

### 4.1 The one identity model

```
┌─ LEASE (data/leases.jsonl, append-only, day-sharded archive) ───────────────┐
│ { leaseId, sessionKey:'sess-<n>-<ms>', conversationId:<uuid|null>,          │
│   poolId, memberId, credDir, credFingerprint, from, to|null, why }          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        ▲ ONE writer: accounts.js (openLease / moveLease / closeLease)
        │   — the only caller of account-material.repointPoolSymlink
        │   — the device's sealed-orders reflex reports through accounts.noteDeviceLease
        │
        ▼ ONE reader: identityOf(session, at) → {accountId, leaseId, credFingerprint, confidence}
   readings · rejections · COST · fire target · ledger attribution · UI badge
```

The lease is a **promotion of `src/slot-transitions.js`**, not a new invention: that file is 161
lines, already append-only, already single-writer, and already carries the day-sharded rotation
that fixed the same-millisecond overwrite bug. Two upgrades make it authoritative:

- it carries **both id namespaces** (webui `sess-<n>-<ms>` **and** the claude conversation UUID),
  which **deletes** `reading-repair`'s `_sessionKeyMap` filename join rather than maintaining it —
  that join exists only because the two stores are keyed in different namespaces;
- it carries `credFingerprint` (a digest of the token **material**, computed in
  `src/account-material.js`, DEVICE tier, so the daemon bundle carries one implementation). This
  kills the mtime-as-evidence class: `repointPoolSymlink` bumps the target's mtime on **every**
  re-point, and three consumers read that mtime as history (`login-state`'s `since`,
  `reading-repair`'s death markers, `login-expiry-watch`'s `writtenAt`). The engine already
  learned this lesson once for `credsTokenSig` and never converted the others.

The symlink stops being state. It becomes the **materialization** of the current lease, read only
by the boot reconciler and by `moveLease`'s own read-before-write.

### 4.2 The one write path

```
producers ──── envelope {leaseId, payload, producedAt, source} ────┐

                                             disputed → DO NOT MOVE the odometer;
                                                        append to data/usage-quarantine.ndjson
                                                        with both identities + reason;
                                                        raise a dispute (notice + inbox + broadcast)
```

A producer **declares** its lease id; it never names an account. That is the property that makes
the eighth producer structurally incapable of re-creating the bug.

The **phase falsifier** is defence in depth, not the foundation, and it is declared per harness:

- `backend-caps.quotaWindowFingerprint`: `'weekly-phase'` for claude, **`null` for codex**
  (measured: 53 clusters — its window is rolling), `null` for opencode / shell / `NO_CAPS`.
- It **proves foreign, never proves native**: two members merged into one org share a phase — and
  then they also share a quota, so the misattribution is harmless for the values.
- Closed reason set: `own-window` · `window-rolled` · `no-prior (TOFU)` · `no-window` ·
  `live-window-replaced` · `foreign-phase` · `scoped-window-split` · `sibling-window(<member>)`.
  Only the last three plus `live-window-replaced` are DISPUTES.
- The tolerance is **the same 120s constant `src/usage-estimator.js:132` already uses**, imported,
  not re-declared — two rules for one physical fact is how twins are born.

### 4.3 What is REMOVED

| Removed | Why |
|---|---|
| `resolveUsageKey`, `sessionBillingMember`, `validateBillingSlot`, `wallSlotFor`, `wallKeyFor`, `rejectionSlotFor`, `readingSlotFor`, `fireIdentityFor`'s resolution | Seven answers to one question, two lifetimes. `identityOf` replaces all of them. |
| `session._turnReadingSlot`, the `key`/`slot` fields of `_turnWallSigs` (+ their schema rows) | The pins exist only because the link can move mid-turn. With §4.4 the lease **is** the pin — and a durable one; the in-memory pins die with the process. |
| The identity-group **sibling write fan-out** (`rate-limit-capture.js:155-163`) | It applies a bucket to every sibling file *without* its `fetchedAt`, which is why `__global__.json` is a live chimera of three accounts under a 6-hour-stale stamp — and `poolReadCache` then lets the group's "freshest" file decide a pool member's quota. A group becomes a **read-time view**; a view cannot rot. |
| The statusline `.slot-<session_id>` fingerprint sidecar + its one-request-lag logic | It exists only because the link moves. It also has **zero production coverage here** (`VIBESPACE_ACCOUNT_LINK` is injected only for local claude *terminal* sessions; every pooled session on this instance is chat, and no `.slot-*` file has ever been created). |
| The `utimesSync` bump in `repointPoolSymlink` | Nothing re-reads mid-turn any more, and it is the mechanism that destroyed the repair's evidence. **Must not land before §4.4**, or hot switching stops working while still being attempted. |
| `slotAt`'s time-join oracle, `_sessionKeyMap`, `ownLinkUnknown` | Superseded by a lease carrying both ids. |
| The OTel **money path** (`observedMemberFor`, `corroborateReading`, the `usageIdentityAccountIds` expansion inside `demoteWalledAccount`, the `corroborated` label plumbing) | `organization.id` names the **spawn** identity; it has been measured wrong and refuted twice, and the "token stale ≥25 min" forensic that justified it was performed *through the channel it was validating*. It fires ~150×/hour here and is consumed by one tooltip. |
| The single-client cold-restart loop (`usage-pool-engine.js:2018`, `for (...) { …; break; }`) | Replaced by a server-side executor (§4.4b). |

### 4.4 What is ADDED

**(a) Turn-boundary lease moves.** A lease may open or move only when the session has no turn in
flight — the boundary each stdout consumer already declares (`noteTurnEnd`). A switch decided
mid-turn is RECORDED as pending and applied at the boundary. A **hard escape** (dead login, or a
hard-exhausted current member) still moves immediately and records why.

> **Rejected: mint-once binding + respawn.** It reaches the same guarantee, but requires killing
> and respawning the conversation to change accounts — a full context re-send priced at ~$19 for
> one large session on this instance, ×9 concurrent conversations, on every switch. A turn
> boundary closes the in-flight window *just as structurally* (nothing is in flight at a boundary)
> while preserving the capability six subscriptions were bought for. Deleting mid-conversation
> switching is a product decision, not a hardening. → §6 D1.

**(b) A server-side rebind executor** (`src/server/rebind.js`). The four re-point call sites emit
`rebindRequest{sessionId, from, to, reason, at}`; the executor applies it at the boundary and
broadcasts to **all** clients. This is not optional: codex is `hotSwitch:'impossible'`, so every
codex account change is a cold restart, and today that restart is delivered to at most one
connected browser while the notice says *"restarting its conversations"* unconditionally.

**(c) The spend authorizer** (`src/spend-authorizer.js`, PURE + `data/spend-budget.json`):

```
authorizeUnattendedSpend({reason, sessionId, identity, quotaView, credentialState,
                          budgetState, overage, now}) → {ok, why, retryAfter, notice}
```

Refuses when: identity unknown/unproven · credential state not `serves:'yes'` · quota unknown ·
**overage in use** (real dollars) without explicit opt-in · the rolling per-identity or
per-instance budget is spent. Counters persist across restarts. All seven producers call it —
auto-resume, the Stop nudge, Background-Work notifications, agent messages, the goal loop, the CI
probes, codex reset-credit — and their existing local floors stay as UX niceties.

**(d) Ledger ↔ OTel aggregate reconciliation** (`src/server/usage-reconcile.js`). Every 5 min,
join `otel-truth.ndjson` against the ledger's totals **on the ledger's own rid key**, per identity,
reporting the delta *and the coverage*. Zero vendor calls — the CLI pushes these to our own
loopback receiver.

> **Rejected: deleting the OTel receiver.** The 2026-09-07 refutation was about **routing one
> reading**; it does not invalidate an aggregate cross-check. This is the only measurement that
> still works on a harness with **no window fingerprint** — i.e. on codex — and it is the only
> thing that would surface the contradiction the audit found (97.9% of the month's ledger booked
> to two members while three others' own `/usage` panels read 0.99 / 0.95 / 0.55).

**(e) A re-runnable, content-keyed repair.** The evidence rung becomes the lease ledger + the
falsifier; `deathMarkers` (the wiped-mtime rung) is deleted. It **marks and quarantines, never
deletes**, runs on the ledger tick, and REPORTS what it repaired versus what it could not date —
so "repaired 2 of 464" can never again be mistaken for success. Schema migrations keep
run-at-most-once; only evidence-based repairs change.

**(f) Two build-time censuses** (P1, P4) plus a **fixed session-schema detector**: widen
`/(session|sess)\._x\s*=/` to any identifier, and register the 8 fields it currently misses —
including `s._lastStopNudge`, the sole rate limiter on the largest measured automatic spender.

**(g) Provenance where the decision is made.** Wire `src/lib/usage-source.js` into
`src/lib/manage-agents.js` and `usage-window.js`; add `evidenceNote` / `disputeText`; name
`on-demand-remote`; replace the enumerated source assertion with a **census** (every string
literal assigned to a `source` field must appear in the table).

### 4.5 How a new producer / consumer is prevented by construction

| Failure mode | Structural block |
|---|---|
| A new producer names an account itself | It has no way to. It declares a `leaseId`; `writeReading` resolves. |
| A new producer writes the cache directly | `test-usage-write-path` (grep-derived) fails the build. |
| A new consumer re-derives session→account | `test-architecture` derivation census fails the build. |
| A new backend inherits a guard it does not have | `quotaWindowFingerprint` must be DECLARED; `NO_CAPS` says `null`, so the falsifier is off and the boundary rule + reconciler carry it. |
| A new unattended-spend path forgets the ceiling | `test-spend-paths` (grep-derived) fails the build. |
| A shipped tool predating the change sends no lease | `confidence:'unknown'` ⇒ quarantine + telemetry, **never a guess**. Capability-gated off the wrapper sidecar caps, exactly as frame-file was. |
| A fixture makes the defect unrepresentable | P12: distinct windows per member; negative controls are patched copies of the real module with an applied-assertion. |

## 5. Phased plan

Five phases. Each is independently shippable and reversible; **nothing destroys a store**.

### P0 — MEASURE (dark; no behaviour change)

Shadow the phase falsifier at every write (telemeter, stamp, change nothing) · shadow
`slot-vs-lease` divergence at all five resolvers, split by caller so the **unpinned cost**
resolver is measured separately · shadow the lease record beside the symlink · the two censuses ·
the schema detector · the fixture fixes (P12) · name `on-demand-remote`.

**Gate:** one soak week. Four numbers before anything may refuse: divergence by resolver, disputes
by producer, rebinds per pool per hour, and — the empirical answer to the standing contradiction
in this codebase (the mtime-re-read rationale vs the 2.361.0 forensics of a process billing its
spawn org for 35 minutes across four switches) — **whether a re-point reaches a running CLI at
all**. If it does not, §6 D1 answers itself.

### P1 — ONE WRITE PATH

`src/usage-cache-write.js` + the four writers rewired · falsifier ENFORCING (quarantine) ·
`quotaWindowFingerprint` caps row · delete the sibling fan-out · mint stable identity ids and
re-key anchor streams.

**Gate:** `test-usage-write-path` green with its printed census covering all known writers; no
regressions in `test-rate-limit-capture` / `test-usage-anchors`; quarantine rate inside the P0
envelope.

### P2 — ONE IDENTITY

`src/leases.js` (promoting `slot-transitions.js`) · `credFingerprint` · `identityOf` delegating to
the old bodies **behind a flag** with the divergence counter still running · turn-pin cost · then
the deletion commit for the seven resolvers and the two pins.

**Gate:** divergence counter identically **0** over a soak; `test-architecture` derivation census
allowlist down to `src/leases.js` + `src/accounts.js` — that emptiness *is* the completeness proof.

### P3 — THE BOUNDARY

Turn-boundary-only lease moves (hard escapes exempt) · `src/server/rebind.js` server-side executor
· belt exemption requires a MEASURED reading · both money gates fail closed · NEAR_MS becomes a
lease-open precondition instead of an unreachable float tiebreak.

**Gate:** `test-turn-boundary-switch` + `test-pool-cascade` green with pre-fix negative controls
reproducing I5; a switch delivered with **zero** websocket clients connected.

### P4 — BOUNDED SPEND & HONEST SURFACES

**SHIPPED 2026-09-08 (the spend half):** the spend authorizer + persisted budget + overage gating +
EDF reserve floor + the Stop nudge (D8) + all three money-gate layers failing closed + overage provenance
in BOTH quota panels, gated by `scripts/test-spend-paths.mjs` (a grep-derived producer census, PER SITE).
**2026-09-09** added the third fail-closed layer (auto-resume's own, driven rather than grepped), the
per-site census, and the two `SETTINGS_CATEGORIES` entries without which none of the seven settings this
half introduced could be opened at all — plus `test-architecture` §44 so a category is never again a knob
nobody can turn. **NOT shipped:**
the rebind budget (it needs the §4.4b executor), `usage-reconcile`, the re-runnable repair, the rest of
the Manage Agents provenance work and the promotion of the ungated money suites.

The spend authorizer + budget + overage gating + EDF reserve floor + rebind budget ·
`usage-reconcile` · the re-runnable repair · provenance in Manage Agents · promote the ungated
money suites (`test-creds-symlink-swap` — rewritten to call the real primitive —
`test-sealed-orders`, `test-workflow-usage-tailer`, `test-remote-attribution`, `test-usage-link`).

**Gate:** `test-spend-paths` green; the repair's report reconciles against the P0 census.

### 5.1 The tests that would have caught each incident

| # | Test | Negative control (must reproduce the incident) |
|---|---|---|
| **I1** | `test-lease-identity` §fire: a rejection arrives, the pool decides a switch; assert the link does not move before the boundary, the fire target and the rejecting identity are **one object**, and the breaker quarantines the member that actually refused. Plus: a `result:is_error` turn must NOT clear the breaker. | A patched copy restoring the fresh `wallKeyFor` resolution ⇒ ≥10 unbounded fires, wrong member quarantined. *(The shipped suite instead **asserted** the loop, verbatim.)* |
| **I2** | `test-reading-fingerprint`: every fixture member gets a **different** phase (impossible today, `:88`); drive the real producers across a switch; assert every anchor's phase matches its filed account. Plus a corpus leg over a copy of `data/usage-anchors` asserting **zero** foreign. | The pre-choke-point writer ⇒ N foreign anchors. |
| **I3** | `test-credential-state`: (a) a source census asserting exactly **one** exported credential-state reader; (b) a member with both tokens expired but `parseAuth().loggedIn` true can never be a lease-open target; (c) a stat-succeeds-read-fails file is UNKNOWN, not dead. | Today's fold, which hard-excludes it and memoizes the exclusion on an mtime that then never changes. |
| **I4** | `test-login-warnings` §retract, **fingerprint-keyed**: rotate the token material, assert every open claim about the old fingerprint is retracted; assert it survives a restart; assert a same-fingerprint rewrite retracts nothing; assert two same-named accounts do not share one inbox item id. | The pre-fix three-clause `reloggedIn` heuristic, which cannot fire when the new credential lands with no readable deadline. |
| **I5** | `test-turn-boundary-switch`: **re-point first, then** deliver the turn's first reading — the ordering the existing §3 does not cover, because it delivers a reading first and the lazy pin is already set. Plus `test-pool-cascade` replaying I5's exact timeline and asserting **at most one** switch. | Today's mid-turn re-point ⇒ the 13%→93% jump; the pre-fix engine ⇒ all four switches in 4m40s. |
| **all** | The three grep-derived censuses (derivations, cache writers, spend paths) + P12's anti-pinning rule. | Three gate suites pinned the refuted routing with **source regexes** for 14–19 days, so the correct fix could not land without editing the tests. Pin the SHAPE, never the ANSWER. |

## 6. Owner decisions

**D1 — Mid-turn switching.** (a) keep as-is; (b) **turn-boundary moves, hard escapes exempt**;
(c) mint-once + respawn.
→ **Recommend (b).** It closes the in-flight class structurally at a fraction of (c)'s cost and
keeps the capability. Cost: a voluntary escape waits up to one turn. P0 measures whether (a) ever
worked; if it did not, (b) is strictly a gain.

**D2 — EDF above 90%.** Should EDF stop draining the soonest-deadline member at a reserve floor?
Today the only stop is the 8% settle bar, `test-pool-auto:85-88` **pins** an 88%-consumed member
as a valid target, and the measured behaviour is 60%→95% in 12.4h.
→ **Recommend a floor (suggest 15% weekly)** for VOLUNTARY switches only; escapes ignore it. This
changes a deliberately pinned, user-requested invariant, so it is yours.

**D3 — Overage / pay-per-use.** (a) surface only; (b) **surface + refuse all unattended spend
while `overage.inUse`**; (c) (b) + the pool avoids an overage-enabled member; (d) a dollar cap.
→ **Recommend (b) now, (c) after one week of data.** With overage on, utilization stays under 1
while every token is billed, so the EDF ranking actively *prefers* the account spending money. The
numbers already exist and have zero consumers.

**D4 — Subscription credentials on remote hosts.** `accounts.shipSubscriptionToRemote` is
default-off, but a `claude setup-token` **oat** rides the env channel to ssh and dial hosts with
the ship gate explicitly not firing. (a) keep; (b) **bring oat under the same gate and the same
authorizer, keep default-off**; (c) block entirely.
→ **Recommend (b).** The ban-postmortem risk is a subscription-derived token on a datacenter IP;
the oat reaches the same IPs without passing the gate built for that risk. The loss there is not a
turn, it is the subscription.

**D5 — Disputed-member policy.** (a) keep as a candidate on its last PROVEN reading; (b) **not a
switch TARGET and no unattended spend, but it keeps serving its own conversation**; (c) fully
ineligible.
→ **Recommend (b).** (a) lets a genuinely burning account keep being chosen; (c) can freeze the
pool. Quarantine clears on the next self-naming panel read.

**D6 — Unattended spend budget.** Proposal to react to: **12 turns/hour and 60/day per identity,
200/day per instance**, notice at 80%, owner-typed turns never counted. **Revised 2026-09-15 (owner, 2.369.98): 30/h · 200/day per identity · 800/day per instance** — the per-slot hour cap is shared by every conversation on the pool target, and 12/h was reached twice in one day by one watcher-heavy session plus a sibling's auto-resumes, stashing every Background Work notification until the owner's next prompt.

**D7 — Implicit pool membership.** This instance's only pool is `members:null` and is the default
account, so every newly logged-in subscription instantly becomes a target for every live
conversation — while `_healPoolsAfterRemoval` refuses to widen an explicit list *because widening
is dangerous*.
→ **Recommend: convert to an explicit list at migration (today's members grandfathered) +
`autoEnrol:false`.** Never silently empty a pool on upgrade.

**D8 — The Stop nudge.** (a) leave; (b) **persist its cooldown and put it under the authorizer**;
(c) opt-in per task group.
→ **Recommend (b)**, and add an exit condition: a session with no status record at all is
currently nudged forever.

**D9 — Re-repair authority.** May the new content-keyed repair MARK (never delete) the ~464
foreign anchors the one-shot could not see, which are still training `rates.json`?
→ **Recommend yes** — marking is reversible and the alternative is permanent poisoning.

**D10 — Sealed orders.** The device reflex is argued structurally dead (argv-substring match
against chat-only pipe metas; the link env is terminal-only) and its suite is outside the gate.
(a) fix it so it can fire; (b) **re-scope to "the device may REFUSE to keep spending"**;
(c) delete and stop shipping every member's credential paths on each 30s tick.
→ **Recommend (b)**, since a device re-pointing credentials is incompatible with the boundary rule
either way. Requires sign-off: it was never exercised in either direction.

**D11 — The OTel receiver.** Its money path goes regardless. (a) **keep as the aggregate
reconciler (§4.4d)**; (b) keep as a debug store; (c) delete.
→ **Recommend (a).** It is the only cross-check that works where the fingerprint does not.

**D12 — Codex pools.** No fingerprint (53 clusters), `hotSwitch:'impossible'` (always cold), and
today the restart needs an open browser. (a) **keep, protected by the boundary rule + the
server-side executor + reconciliation**; (b) declare unsupported until (a) ships.
→ **Recommend (a)**, sequenced so P3 lands before any codex pool is created.

## 7. What stays as-is, and why

| Kept | Reason |
|---|---|
| **§ban-safety, byte for byte.** | Every mechanism here computes from bytes we already hold: the phase is in a payload we receive passively, the reconciliation is our own loopback stash, the lease is our own file. `scripts/test-vendor-whitelist.mjs` must remain **unchanged** — if a change to it is needed, this design is wrong. |
| **auto-cli `claude -p /usage` as the trust anchor.** | It is the one producer where the cache key and `CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR` are ONE decision, so it is the only self-naming reading and the only thing that can clear a dispute. Its burn-aware wandering cadence is unchanged. *(Caveat: two mid-August `on-demand` anchors carry a foreign phase, so the bootstrap rule needs an explicit tie-break rather than blind trust.)* |
| **EDF as the ranking policy.** | Quota is perishable; draining the soonest-expiring window first is the owner's deliberate choice. Only its DEPTH (D2) and the trustworthiness of its inputs are in scope. |
| **The 180s dwell belt and the settle bar.** | Correct anti-oscillation. Only the *exemption* changes: it must be earned by a measured reading (P7). |
| **The loop breaker's local floors** (`FIRE_QUARANTINE_MS`, the 30s peer-pair floor, identical-text dedup, quiet-success). | Good UX rate-limiting. They stop being the *money* bound; the authorizer becomes that. |
| **`login-expiry` + `login-state` merged, but both vocabularies preserved on the record.** | The merge is required (P6) so "disputed" and "unusable" share one language; no caller may lose information. |
| **Plan C per-session links.** | The granularity is right — an opus conversation and a fable conversation *should* be able to bill different members. What changes is *when* a link may move, not that it exists. The measured herd behaviour (nine sessions moving at the same millisecond) is a symptom of shared inputs, not of plan C. |
| **`repointPoolSymlink`'s lstat guard + atomic rename.** | Correct. Only the `utimesSync` side effect goes, and only after §4.4. |
| **Remote / oat / codex spawn-time binding.** | Remote sessions tar credentials at spawn; oat rides env; codex canonicalizes `CODEX_HOME` at startup. All three are **already** immutable-per-process — this design makes local claude stop being the exception, rather than making it the special case everyone else has to be checked against. |
| **Schema migrations run-at-most-once.** | Only *evidence-based repairs* become re-runnable (P11). Reshaping a store twice is a different hazard. |
