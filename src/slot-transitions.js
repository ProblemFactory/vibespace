// THE SLOT-TRANSITION LEDGER (2026-09-07, readings-by-slot part 2).
//
// A pooled conversation's billing identity is a SYMLINK, and a symlink has no
// history: `poolCurrentFor()` can only ever answer "where does it point NOW".
// Every attribution question that arrives LATE — a reading whose fetchedAt is
// two minutes old, a ledger event baked by a scan that ran after the switch,
// a migration asked to clean up last week — therefore had no way to answer
// "which member was this conversation on AT THAT MOMENT", and the code filled
// the gap with the only durable identity it had: the org the CLI cached at
// SPAWN (OTel `organization.id`). That is the misattribution this ledger
// removes at the root: every re-point of a credential link appends a line, so
// the past is a lookup instead of an inference.
//
// Shape (append-only NDJSON, data/slot-transitions.jsonl):
//   {"sessionId":"sess-…","poolId":"pool-…","from":"sub-a","to":"sub-b",
//    "at":1788…, "why":"per-session-switch"}
//   sessionId null = the POOL DEFAULT link moved (it decides for every session
//   that has no link of its own).
//
// BOUNDED, archive-never-destroy: past MAX lines the oldest half is MOVED to
// data/archive/slot-transitions-<YYYYMMDD>.jsonl (appended, never deleted — the
// migration and any future re-attribution read it), live file keeps the tail.
