/**
 * rate-limit-capture.js — passive quota capture from the CLI's own
 * `rate_limit_event` stream-json records (B-e5c9, discovered by binary
 * forensics on 2.1.226: a first-class stdout record type "emitted when rate
 * limit info changes", riding real API responses — VibeSpace dropped it as
 * an unknown type since forever).
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS: chat/stream-json sessions have no statusline, so their
 * accounts' quota showed last-known only. This record closes that gap with
 * ZERO extra API calls (§ban-safety: purely passive — nothing here may ever
 * originate a vendor call), and `status:"rejected"` is a STRUCTURED
 * exhaustion signal (the banner-text parse's typed sibling). Utilization
 * readings become dead-reckoning anchors for free (the anchors sweep treats
 * any usage-cache write as ground truth).
 *
 * ONE implementation for every machine (CS rule): the server calls this for
 * local AND remote chat sessions (remote stdout relays through the same
 * parse), and the module is deliberately dependency-free (fs/path only) so
 * the device daemon can bundle it when session.events moves device-side.
 *
 * Fields (builder `wFb` in the 2.1.226 binary): status(allowed/rejected)/
 * resetsAt/rateLimitType/utilization/overageStatus/overageResetsAt/
 * overageDisabledReason/isUsingOverage/overageInUse/surpassedThreshold/
 * rateLimitGraceActive/overagePeriodMonthly/overagePeriodChannel/errorCode/
 * canUserPurchaseCredits/hasChargeableSavedPaymentMethod. All optional —
 * real captured samples carried only status+resetsAt+type+overage.
