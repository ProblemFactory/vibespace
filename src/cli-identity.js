/**
 * THE agent-CLI process identity — ONE rule, expressed twice (B-3185 r3).
 *
 * "Is pid N the `claude` / `codex` CLI?" is asked by three consumers that used
 * to answer it three different ways:
 *
 *   · the pre-resume WRITER SWEEP (src/writer-sweep.js) — decides who receives
 *     a SIGTERM, runs as POSIX shell on this machine, an ssh host or a dialed
 *     device;
 *   · the ssh discovery CO leg (src/hosts.js) — decides which codex threads are
 *     RUNNING, same shell, embedded VERBATIM from here;
 *   · the DISCOVERY FACTS (src/discovery-facts.js) — the local listing, the
 *     device snapshot's lock scan and its CO lines, in JavaScript.
 *
 * B-3185 replaced the substring/whole-argv rule with an EXECUTABLE test in the
 * shell copies and left the JS copy alone, recording the twin instead of
 * killing it. That record was the honest thing to do and also the thing the
 * STANDING SWEEP exists to stop: a rule with two spellings has two behaviours
 * the moment either is touched. Both spellings now live in THIS file, side by
 * side, and scripts/test-writer-sweep.mjs drives the SAME live pids through
 * both and demands the same verdict.
 *
 * THE RULE, in three rungs, because the CLI ships in three shapes:
 *   1. argv[0]'s BASENAME is the CLI name (`~/.local/bin/claude`, the vendor's
 *      `…/vendor/<triple>/bin/codex`) — the measured shape of a real install;
 *   2. argv[0] is an INTERPRETER (node/bun/deno) and its first NON-FLAG operand
 *      is the CLI's entry point (`node <prefix>/bin/claude`,
 *      `node …/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js`, `node …/@openai/codex/bin/codex.js`);
 *   3. the EXECUTABLE IMAGE is the CLI (`/proc/<pid>/exe` basename), or it is
 *      the native install's version file (`…/<name>/versions/<ver>`, whose
 *      basename is a version number) AND the process still PRESENTS as the CLI.
 *
 * Never a later argument, never the whole command line: the retired rule fired
 * on `tail -f ~/.claude/projects/<id>.jsonl`, on an editor with the transcript
 * open, and on a test process running from a worktree under ~/.claude/ — which
 * matched its own guard and SIGTERMed itself.
 *
 * RUNG 3 IS NARROWED BY THE PRESENTATION (r2). The CLI RE-EXECS ITS OWN IMAGE
 * as its bundled helper tools: measured live on the dev box, twice, minutes
 * apart, 18–19 processes have an exe under `…/.local/share/claude/versions/<ver>`
 * and 2–3 of them are `ugrep -G --ignore-files …` whose argv[0] is a bare
 * `ugrep`. "Runs the CLI's binary image" is therefore NOT "is the CLI". The
 * rung takes either honest presentation — argv[0] basename STARTS WITH the CLI
 * name (a launcher that names it), or argv[0] basename EQUALS the exe basename
 * (nothing was renamed: a wrapper's `exec "$IMG" "$@"`) — and a re-exec'd
 * helper satisfies neither, because it renames itself to the tool it runs.
 *
 * `(deleted)` IS STRIPPED FROM THE IMAGE (r3). When the image file is replaced
 * on disk while the process runs, the kernel appends ` (deleted)` to
 * /proc/<pid>/exe — and that is not an exotic state: it is exactly what the
 * claude auto-updater and `npm i -g @openai/codex` do to LIVE sessions. Without
 * the strip, both executable rungs miss (basename `claude (deleted)`, and the
 * "nothing was renamed" disjunct compares `2.1.257` against `2.1.257 (deleted)`),
 * so the ONE process the sweep exists to stop — a mid-update CLI still writing
 * the transcript — survived it. The double-writer corruption class the sweep
 * prevents is most likely precisely when an update has just landed.
 *
 * ARGV IS A LIST OF NUL-SEPARATED WORDS, AND A WORD MAY CONTAIN A NEWLINE
 * (r4). The JS side reads that list directly; the shell side could not, so it
 * turned NULs into newlines and took the Nth LINE — which is the FIRST LINE of
 * the Nth word. The two spellings therefore disagreed about who a process is
 * exactly when a word carries a newline, and the disagreement pointed the wrong
 * way on a KILL path: argv[0] `/opt/x/claude<LF>/usr/bin/tail` is basename
 * `tail` to JS and `claude` to the old shell (verified on a live process). The
 * shell now parks real newlines on \001 across the line select, so "the Nth
 * line" IS "the Nth NUL-record" in both spellings, and the `ps` fallback
 * flattens its blob the way the JS twin's /\s+/ split already did.
 *
 * THAT LAST CLAUSE WAS PROSE UNTIL r5. `vs_argv`'s `else` branch only runs
 * where there is no /proc, so on a Linux box every fixture takes the rung
 * above it and the sentence had no assertion behind it. test-writer-sweep §15
 * now DRIVES it without editing a byte of this file: it re-roots `/proc/$1/`
 * (all THREE literals — leaving the exe read live lets rung 3 answer and the
 * `ps` rung never decides), puts a stand-in `ps` first on PATH (measured:
 * procps renders an embedded newline as a SPACE, so this box's own `ps`
 * cannot produce the input the flattening exists for), and runs `procArgv` /
 * `isCliProcess` in a child whose /proc reads THROW so the JS twin really
 * takes its own fallback. Both must return the same word and the same
 * verdict; the control is this line without the `tr`.
 *
 * …AND THE VALUE STILL HAD TO SURVIVE `$(…)`, WHICH STRIPS EVERY TRAILING
 * NEWLINE (r4, second half — found by MEASURING the first half rather than
 * describing it). A word or path that ENDS in one read `…/claude` in the shell
 * and `…/claude<LF>` in JS: the shell said YES where this file says NO, on the
 * paths that kill. All three captures were affected — argv[0] (rung 1), the
 * interpreter operand (rung 2) and `readlink /proc/<pid>/exe` (rung 3, which no
 * argv fixture can reach) — and a TRAILING \001 was eaten the same way, since
 * the park byte comes back out as a newline. `vs_cap` below captures all three:
 * a sentinel byte inside the subshell protects the tail, then exactly one
 * terminator — the one the producer printed — comes off.
 *
 * THE SHELL TEXT RUNS UNDER THE REMOTE LOGIN SHELL, NOT `sh`. The device rung
 * runs it as `sh -c`, but both ssh rungs — the sweep's fallback
 * (writer-sweep.js sweepWriters) and the discovery CO leg (hosts.js `_ssh`) —
 * hand the script to `ssh host -- <script>`, which the REMOTE USER'S LOGIN
 * SHELL interprets. So "POSIX sh" is the floor, not the target, and every
 * pattern here has to mean the same thing in zsh too. It bit immediately: in
 * zsh `(…)` is a glob GROUP, so the unquoted `${e% (deleted)}` above matched
 * " deleted" and stripped NOTHING — the r3 fix would have been dead on exactly
 * the hosts whose login shell is zsh (a very common default, including this
 * dev box). Quote any pattern whose literal characters are special somewhere.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY-FREE ON PURPOSE: the agentd bundle carries discovery-facts, so it
 * now carries this too. node builtins only, no repo imports.

 *  answer yields `null` HERE, which means "no evidence", never "gone".

/** ── THE PROCESS TREE, READ WITHOUT FORKING (2026-09-09) ──────────────────
 *
 *  "Who is pid N's parent?" and "which pids did N fork?" are the last two
 *  process-table questions the discovery sweep was asking with a CHILD PROCESS
 *  per item — `ps -p <pid> -o ppid=` for every claude lock file (the tmux pane
 *  lookup) and `pgrep -P <childPid>` for every live session. They live here
 *  with the identity rule for one reason: they are the same kind of fact, read
 *  from the same place, and the answer must not depend on which caller asks.
 *
 *  THE COST IS THE FORK, NOT THE WAIT. `execFile` is asynchronous about the
 *  WAIT; fork(2)/posix_spawn still copies the CALLING process's page tables on
 *  the calling thread, so the parent is BLOCKED for the copy before any child
 *  runs. Measured in a plain node process on the dev box (2026-09-09), one
 *  `spawn('true')`: 1.8 ms at 45 MB RSS, 18.8 ms at 543 MB, 67-73 ms at 1.5 GB.
 *  A server is a 1.5 GB process, and `Promise.all` over N spawns serialises N
 *  of those forks into ONE tick — which is why a 61-lock pod answered every
 *  session create and every kill with an 11-17 s event-loop block, and why the
 *  2.242.0 sync→async fix (which fixed only the wait) did not end the class.

 *  `/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/children` lists what that thread forked (Linux
 *  ≥ 3.5) — pure reads of a virtual filesystem, no fork, no page tables. The
 *  no-/proc rung (macOS/BSD, where "full support" is a README promise) is ONE
 *  `ps -eo pid=,ppid=` FOR THE WHOLE SWEEP, memoised — never one exec per pid,
 *  which is the shape being retired.
 *
 *  A VALUE READ, NEVER AN EXISTENCE PROBE (the §17 standing-sweep rule, same

 *       58 MB              23.7 ms              2.0 ms / 87.6 ms
 *      559 MB              23.7 ms             24.4 ms / 110.6 ms
 *    1,564 MB              23.6 ms             69.4 ms / 155.2 ms
 *  So the scan is FLAT in the server's own size while the fork it replaces is
 *  not, and a fleet server IS a 1.5 GB process: at the shape the incident was
 *  reported on this is 69 ms of blocked loop down to 24, and 155 ms of latency
 *  down to 24. HONEST COST: on a freshly booted 58 MB server it is 24 ms of
 *  block where a fork was 2 — bought back four times over in end-to-end
 *  latency, and a predictable cost that stops growing is the whole point of
 *  the class this fix belongs to.
 *
 *  MATCHING IS A LITERAL SUBSTRING, `pgrep -f`'s is an ERE — so this rung is
 *  STRICTLY NARROWER on a path full of `.` and `-`. That is the safe direction
 *  for a caller that SIGTERMs what it finds, and it cannot miss the real
 *  holder, whose argv carries the path verbatim. `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is
 *  NUL-separated where `pgrep` sees spaces, so a needle containing a space is
 *  matched against the joined form; a space-free needle must lie inside ONE

/** `vs_alive <pid>` — DOES THIS PID EXIST, in ONE spelling for every shell that

 *  three transports, under the same floor: `sh -c` on the device rung, and the
 *  REMOTE USER'S LOGIN SHELL on both ssh rungs (the (q) lesson) — so busybox
 *  `ash` is a real floor, not a hypothetical.
 *
 *  EVERY RUNG IS POSITIVE EVIDENCE. `kill -0` is POSIX and a BUILTIN in every
 *  shell that can interpret this text (dash/bash/busybox/zsh/ksh — no fork, no
 *  `ps` dialect), and when it SUCCEEDS the pid exists, full stop. Its FAILURE
 *  is the ambiguous half: kill(2) with signal 0 runs the same permission check
 *  as a real signal, so EPERM (another user's LIVE process) and ESRCH (gone)
 *  share one exit status — which is why a failure is not the verdict here, it
 *  is the question handed to the next rung: `[ -d /proc/N ]` (Linux, incl.
 *  every busybox host, world-visible for processes we may not signal) and then
 *  `ps -p N` (the no-/proc rung: BSD and macOS `ps` do have `-p`). Only when
 *  all three say nothing does the caller get to say "gone".
 *  (Honest edge: under `hidepid=2` a foreign process is invisible to both
 *  /proc rungs and to `ps`, and reads as gone — as it always did.)
 *
 *  IT LIVES HERE BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS ROUND PROVED A PER-SITE REASON IS NOT A
 *  GUARD (r6). r5 fixed `hosts.js killPidShell` and ENUMERATED the sibling —
 *  `src/server/sysinfo-wiring.js signalProc` — then let it keep its own
 *  `ps -p` on a hand-written reason: "there it sits on the FAILURE branch of a
 *  kill that was already attempted, so it can only mislabel an outcome, never
 *  manufacture one". The reason described a script that has TWO `ps -p` calls
 *  and was only true of the second. The FIRST is the post-signal aliveness
 *  check on the SUCCESS branch, and there a busybox-blind probe manufactures
 *  exactly the outcome r5 was hunting: measured on this box (busybox 1.37.0,
 *  a live process with `trap "" TERM`), the pre-r6 script answers `OK-GONE`
 *  ⇒ `signalProc` returns `{ok:true, gone:true}` — the table flips the row to
 *  gone, the user believes the process died, and it is still running. (The
 *  failure branch's mislabel is real too, and also measured: a pid we may not
 *  signal answered `ESRCH` = "no such process (already gone)" instead of
 *  EPERM.) So the probe is not reasoned about per site any more — there is ONE
 *  definition and both scripts embed it, and the suite's STANDING SWEEP fails
 *  any `ps -p` used as an existence test anywhere on a kill/signal path.
 *  **A twin kept alive by a comment is a twin; the comment is only as good as
 *  its author's count of the call sites.**
 *
 *  NO JS TWIN ON PURPOSE. The local branches of the same routes call
 *  `process.kill(pid, 0)` and read `e.code` — node distinguishes EPERM from
 *  ESRCH directly, which is the very thing a shell cannot do and the only
