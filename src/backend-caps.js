// PURE per-backend account/switching capability registry (P4 first slice,
// design-backend-parity.md §4 — owner ask: "把其它agent支持接口化之后怎么区分
// 这些冷切热切之类的feature"). The pool engine consults THIS instead of
// backend-id special cases; a future backend adds a row, never an if-chain.
//
// hotSwitch is a VERDICT, not a wish:
//   'verified'   — forensically proven live re-read (claude: dir-symlink
//                  survives atomic cred writes, env re-resolved per syscall,
//                  CLI re-reads .credentials.json per request —
//                  scripts/test-creds-symlink-swap.mjs).
//   'impossible' — experimentally REFUTED (codex, 2026-08-24 P3: the
//                  app-server canonicalizes CODEX_HOME at startup — a symlink
//                  repoint never reaches a running process — AND a turn
//                  completed fine after auth.json's content was swapped to
//                  garbage tokens ⇒ tokens live in process memory).
//   'unverified' — no experiment yet; treat as cold.
// A pool on a backend without hotSwitch 'verified' always cold-restarts
// (kill → exited → resume), whatever its `hot` flag says.
// streamProtocol names the live stdout PARSE PIPELINE a chat session needs —
// session-stdout resolves THIS through the consumer registry
// (src/server/stdout/index.js, harness S5), never the backend id, so a backend
// without a registered consumer fails loudly at session start instead of being
// silently parsed as claude stream-json (the gemini-as-claude fallthrough
// class). This row is the ONE source of truth for the protocol — the harness
// descriptor's caps IS this row; it carries no separate stdout:{protocol}.
// peerDelivery names the LIVE lane for agent-to-agent/job messages
// (conversation-deliver consults this, never the backend id):
//   'cli-inbox'  — the CLI's own cross-session inbox socket (claude:
//                  ~/.claude/sessions registry; idle receiver opens a billed
//                  turn — the CLI's documented behavior, not ours).
//   'rpc-queue'  — the wrapper OWNS the app-server RPC connection (codex,
//                  2026-08-25 research): idle ⇒ turn/start (billed turn +
//                  reply, claude-inbox parity); busy ⇒ thread/queue/add runs
//                  it after the current turn (upstream-test-pinned semantics).
//                  Contract for any backend claiming this: its wrapper adverts
//                  sidecar caps.peerMessage and serves the 'peer-message'
//                  stdin verb, reporting peer_message_result honestly.
//   'stash-only' — no live lane; messages queue for next-turn injection.
// inputModes names what a SEND DURING A TURN can do on this harness — the
// queue/steer surface (ws 'queue-op', the client's queue strip and the bubble
// chip all gate on THIS, never on a backend id). A row declares TWO facts:
//   queue      — a message sent mid-turn is HELD and runs after the turn, and
//                the harness REPORTS that state back to us (a CLI that queues
//                silently still counts: claude's own stdin queue is real, it
//                just has no readable state — see queueVerbs).
//   queueVerbs — THE VERB TABLE (design-harness-features §3.1): the closed set
//                of queue actions this harness actually SERVES. Adding a verb
//                is one array entry + its three implementations (adapter
//                frame, wrapper handler, client control), never a new boolean
//                on five call sites.
// The old `{steer, queueOps}` booleans are kept as a DERIVED VIEW of that list
// (deriveInputModes below, materialized once at module load) so the existing
// consumers keep reading what they always read — but there is exactly ONE
// place to edit, and scripts/test-queue-steer.mjs ① pins the derivation law
// (steer === verbs.includes('steer'), queueOps === verbs.length > 0) on both
// this row AND the client's mirror in src/lib/agent-meta.js.
//   'remove'    — drop a queued item (it never runs).
//   'steer'     — INJECT it into the running turn so the agent sees it at its
//                 next reply (codex `turn/steer`; measured on 0.153.4: several
//                 steers per turn are accepted, and a steer does NOT remove
//                 the queued copy — the wrapper deletes it).
//   'steer-all' — the same, for every queued item in order.
//   'reorder'   — move an item (ws frame: RELATIVE `afterId`; the wrapper
//                 translates it into the app-server's absolute full-order
//                 array — the two layers deliberately do not share vocabulary,
//                 because a full order computed on a stale render would delete
//                 whatever a peer queued in between).
//   'edit'      — rewrite the TEXT of a queued item, preserving every other
//                 input element by exclusion (never a whitelist).
//   'run-now'   — run ONE queued item immediately (idle thread only).
//   'run-all'   — run the whole queue immediately (idle thread only). A
//                 SEPARATE verb, never run-now without an id: one lost id
//                 would otherwise drain the queue.
// A harness that declares a verb it cannot construct is a RED test, so
// "offering a control we cannot honour" (the 2.361.4 accept-and-ignore
// failure) is structurally impossible rather than a review promise.
// turnState names WHERE "is a turn running right now" comes from
// (design-harness-features §3.5). Everything that gates on streaming — the
// composer's Stop button, auto-resume's "it is already working" skip, the
// attach payload's isStreaming — reads ONE flag; this row says whether that
// flag is the harness's own statement or our inference:
//   'authoritative' — the harness PUBLISHES turn state and we drive the flag
//                     from it (claude: system/session_state_changed
//                     {idle|running|requires_action}, the CLI's own words
//                     "authoritative turn-over signal"; codex: turn/started +
//                     turn/completed; ACP: prompt_start / prompt_end's stop
//                     reason). Per SESSION the fact is still tri-state — an
//                     old CLI, or claude without the spawn env below, never
//                     emits one, so the consumer stays on the derived path
//                     until the FIRST record arrives and only THEN reports
//                     authoritative. Declaring it here says the PROTOCOL can,
//                     never that this session did.
//   'derived'       — we infer it from record shapes (no such harness today;
//                     the value exists so a future one can say so honestly).
//   null            — no turn concept at all (shell).
// inProgressTools names the TOOL-GRANULAR truth: whether the harness reports
// which tool_use ids are executing right now. FALSE ON EVERY HARNESS TODAY —
// including claude, whose `set_in_progress_tool_use_ids` record exists and is
// even documented ("Surfaces use this to show which tools are running") but
// NEVER REACHES A STREAM-JSON CONSUMER: 2.1.257 hands it to a host callback
// (`n.onInProgressToolUseIDs?.(e.op); return`, offset 186333979) and the 'add'
// side goes to a callback at tool dispatch without entering that dispatcher at
// all. Measured, not inferred — a probe in chat-wrapper.js's exact spawn shape
// ran 6 tools and saw 0 of these while session_state_changed arrived on the
// same stdout, and 24 production buffers hold 212 tool_use blocks and 0 of
// these. A cap is a PROMISE TO A SURFACE: claiming true here painted a
// "currently executing" dot no user could ever see. The consumer stays (dormant
// with the callback named) and scripts/test-stdout-registry.mjs re-measures the
// wire on every run — the day a CLI forwards the record, that leg goes red and
// says to flip this row. codex/ACP report per-item lifecycle instead, and a
// card's spinner is derived from its own item there.
// CLAUDE'S SPAWN PREREQUISITE (owner decision 8(c), design §5.1): the CLI only
// emits session_state_changed when CLAUDE_CODE_EMIT_SESSION_STATE_EVENTS is in
// its environment — src/adapters/claude-code.js sets it on every claude spawn.
// It is pure observability (no behaviour change), which is why it is the ONE
// spawn default that changed in this batch.
// responseStyle names the harness's "how should the agent talk" knob and,
// crucially, WHEN it can be set (2.369.58 — the chip's "restart to apply" row
// gates on `live`, never on a backend id):
//   values    — the harness's OWN accepted vocabulary. PROTOCOL VALUES, never
//               translated, never guessed: claude's four settings-file output
//               styles; codex's Personality enum, read out of
//               `codex app-server generate-json-schema` on 0.153.4
//               (none | friendly | pragmatic). An empty list = the harness has
//               no such knob and the chip is not drawn at all.
//   closed    — `true` when `values` is the WHOLE accepted vocabulary and the
//               harness REJECTS anything else (codex: a Personality outside the
//               enum fails the RPC), so an out-of-enum value is dropped before
//               it can reach a spawn. `false` when the harness accepts
//               user-defined values too (claude: `~/.claude/output-styles/*.md`
//               are real custom output styles — `values` is only what the
//               PICKER offers, and validating against it would silently eat a
//               user's own style).
//   live      — `true` when a RUNNING session can be re-styled
//               (codex: `thread/settings/update {threadId, personality}`
//               applies from the next turn on the SAME thread);
//               `false` when the value is only read at spawn (claude: it is a
//               --settings key and stream-json has no /output-style, so the
//               menu offers "Restart now to apply").
// THE UNSET RULE (both harnesses): the empty string means "the user made NO
// choice" and the key is then NEVER sent — the agent keeps whatever its own
// config file says. codex's 'none' is a real, DIFFERENT value ("no
// personality"), so it can only arrive from an explicit pick.
// review / renameWriteback / forkAtMessage (§2.13 of
// docs/design-harness-features.md) — three capabilities that were ALREADY
// shipped and gated on a backend id at four call sites, so the client's
// `caps.review` had nothing on the server to be checked against:
//   review           — the harness can start a code review of a target
//                      (codex `review/start` through the wrapper: working
//                      tree / base branch / commit / custom, inline or
//                      detached). The ws 'review-start' gate and the client's
//                      button-availability + read-only poll read THIS.
//   renameWriteback  — renaming the session here also renames it in the
//                      AGENT's own store (codex `set-thread-name` →
//                      thread/setName). claude's transcript has no title
//                      field to write, so a rename stays ours.
//   forkAtMessage    — fork from ONE MESSAGE (claude
//                      `--resume-session-at <uuid> --fork-session`), which is
//                      NOT `fork` above: codex's thread/fork branches the
//                      WHOLE thread and has no per-message boundary, so a
//                      per-message fork button gated on `fork` would be a
//                      button that cannot work. Two capabilities, two rows.
// worktree names the harness's PER-SESSION GIT WORKTREE knob (owner ruling 9,
// design-harness-features §5.1). Every surface — the New Session checkbox, the
// Session Properties row, the session-card badge, the ws refusal — gates on
// THIS row, never on a backend id.
//   supported      — the harness can run a session in its own git worktree.
//   flag           — the EXACT argv token, dumped from `claude --help` on
//                    2.1.257: `-w, --worktree [name]` ("Create a new git
//                    worktree for this session (optionally specify a name)").
//   named          — the flag takes an OPTIONAL name. We never send one: the
//                    CLI's auto-generated name is unique per session, whereas
//                    a name we chose would collide with an existing worktree
//                    (two sessions in one tree) and would put a user string in
//                    argv for no gain.
//   requiresGitRepo — the CLI REFUSES outside a git repo and exits 1 before the
//                    session exists (measured 2026-09-07: "Error: Can only use
//                    --worktree in a git repository, but /tmp/notarepo is not a
//                    git repository."), so we must refuse first, with a reason.
//   hookEscape     — …but "not a git repo" is NOT the whole gate. The 2.1.257
//                    decompiled condition is `if(!pX() && !await rh())` where
//                    `pX(){return fB("WorktreeCreate").length>0}` and `rh()` is
//                    the cached is-git-repo — i.e. the CLI ALSO accepts
//                    --worktree outside a repo when a WorktreeCreate hook is
//                    configured, which is exactly what its own error text
//                    tells you to do ("Configure a WorktreeCreate hook in
//                    settings.json to use --worktree with other VCS systems").
//                    A preflight that is STRICTER than the CLI it protects is
//                    a false refusal, so the hook is a probed fact too and
//                    this row names the event to look for.
//   landsIn/branchPrefix — where it puts the tree, for the honest UI hint.
//                    Measured on 2.1.257: `claude --worktree probe5` in
//                    /tmp/wtprobe created /tmp/wtprobe/.claude/worktrees/probe5
//                    on branch `worktree-probe5` (locked), and the CLI process
//                    CHDIR'd into it (/proc/<pid>/cwd) — which is why the init
//                    frame's `cwd` is the worktree path and is the ONLY typed
//                    record we read it from.
// NEVER `--tmux`: its help says "Create a tmux session for the worktree
// (requires --worktree)", and dtach is our persistence layer — a tmux inside
// our dtach session is a second multiplexer nobody attaches to (owner ruling 9
// spells this out).

// permissionRules names WHERE this harness's permission rules can be READ from
// and at which SCOPE — the read-only "where does this rule come from" view
// (owner ruling 10 of design-harness-features §5.1) gates on THIS row, never

//   session — the SESSION-scoped read is possible (Session Properties). For
//             codex this is true for a REAL reason: `config/read` resolves a
//             `sessionFlags` layer — the `-c` overrides this session was
//             spawned with — which only the session's own app-server can see.
//   instance— the instance-wide read is possible (Manage Agents). claude reads
//             files, so both scopes work; opencode's serve knows nothing about
//             a particular session's cwd, so only the instance scope is true.
//   liveVerb— the session-scoped read needs the RUNNING wrapper to serve the
//             `read-permission-rules` stdin verb (⇒ the per-process advert
//             gate applies, the 2.361.1/2.364.1 skew law). false = the server

// feature — the timer, the loop breaker, the notices, restart survival — is
// VibeSpace's own and harness-neutral (src/server/auto-resume.js), so only
// these two rows may differ per harness:
//   signal — this harness's QuotaSignalSource can CLASSIFY a limit at all
//            (quota.signalFromStream is not the NULL one). A harness with no
//            quota concept can never be armed, and saying so here is what stops
//            a surface from offering the toggle over nothing.
//   resume — HOW a stopped turn is restarted, from a CLOSED set of forms. It is
//            the descriptor's `resume.form`, and the descriptor's `resume
//            .deliver(session, text, deps)` is what actually runs, so a new
//            harness cannot inherit a verb it has not implemented:
//              'message'    a user message on the CLI's own chat stdin
//                           (claude: the wrapper forwards it as stream-json).

//                           the fire path refuses while _isStreaming).

// ── worktree: the PURE spawn rules (owner ruling 9) ─────────────────────────
// FOUR questions, answered here so no surface has to know the CLI's semantics
// (the last two joined in round 2, after the verifier found the fork branch had
// no producer and the untick could not be expressed):
//
//   worktreeRefusal — CAN this spawn honour the request at all? The CLI exits
//     1 outside a git repo BEFORE the session exists, so a refusal here is the
//     difference between "a reason" and "the window died instantly".
//     `isGitRepo` is a TRI-STATE: true / false / null = the probe could not
//     answer (unreachable host, timeout). null is NOT false — refusing a real
//     repo because a probe timed out would be worse than letting the CLI
//     speak for itself, so it passes with `unverified` recorded.
//     `hasWorktreeHook` is the SECOND half of the CLI's own condition (see the
//     caps row: `!pX() && !rh()`), tri-state for the same reason. It can only
//     ever RESCUE a spawn, never cause a refusal — a definite hook makes a
//     definite non-repo legal, because that is precisely the configuration the
//     CLI's error text tells the user to create. The asymmetry is deliberate
//     and it is the conservative direction on BOTH sides: an unknown hook
//     (unreadable settings) still refuses a KNOWN non-repo, because there the
//     alternative is the instantly-dead window this preflight exists to
//     prevent — and the refusal message names the hook so a mis-detected hook
//     user is told exactly which configuration we failed to see, rather than
//     being left with "not a git repository" and no way forward.
//
//   worktreeSpawnArgs — does THIS spawn pass the flag? Not "did the user tick
//     the box": the CLI RECORDS the worktree on the session and RE-ENTERS it
//     by itself on --resume (2.1.257 decompiled: the resume path calls
//     y6(host, se.worktreeSession) and reports 'worktree-gone' / "cannot
//     resume into worktree …" when that fails), while --fork-session
//     explicitly STRIPS the binding (Une(se, {stripWorktreeSession:true})).
//     So:  new  + want ⇒ pass          (create the worktree)
//          fork + want ⇒ pass          (the fork inherits nothing)
//          resume      ⇒ NEVER pass    (a second --worktree = a SECOND
//                                       worktree; the CLI re-enters its own)
//     A resume of a session whose worktree was deleted continues in the plain
//     cwd and says so — the CLI's own notice, which we do not second-guess.
//
//   worktreePick — WHICH answer a surface must give to "would the NEXT run of
//     this conversation be isolated?". Two facts feed it and they are not the
//     same thing (round-2 verifier, MAJOR: the fork path read NEITHER, so the
//     `fork ⇒ pass` branch above had no producer in production at all — a
//     fork of an isolated conversation quietly ran in the user's real working
//     tree while Session Properties promised otherwise):
//       saved — the per-session PICK (`cfg.worktree`), TRI-STATE:
//               true      = the user asked for it (New Session tick, or the
//                           Session Properties checkbox),
//               false     = the user explicitly said NO — and nothing may
//                           resurrect that, least of all a live run that
//                           happens to be isolated (this used to be a
//                           truthy-only stored key, so unticking the box while
//                           the run WAS isolated re-checked itself on the next
//                           render: an accept-and-ignore control, 2.361.4),
//               undefined = no pick on record, which is the NORMAL state right
//                           after a New Session tick (the conversation has no
//                           id yet when the box is ticked).
//       live  — what the RUN we are looking at turned out to be, i.e. the
//               init-frame arbiter's verdict.
//     An absent pick therefore defers to the live fact, which is exactly what
//     the Session Properties checkbox has always DISPLAYED — so the fork and
//     the checkbox now answer with ONE function instead of two paraphrases.
//
//   worktreeLatchWrite — should the saved pick RECORD what this run turned out
//     to be? ONE-WAY on purpose: only an ABSENT pick is ever written, and only
//     to `true`. The live fact is the CLI's and it can drop on its own (a
//     deleted worktree), so letting it write would silently discard a
//     preference because of a transient; and an explicit `false` is a decision
//     the user made, which a fact never overrules.
