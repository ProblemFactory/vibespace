/**
 * quota-model.js — PURE (imports nothing, CJS so the bundle and the shipped
 * statusline tool can both carry it): THE TYPED LIMIT SET.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG WITHOUT IT (three incidents, one root). Every quota reading
 * this product has ever taken was flattened into a HAND-SHAPED snapshot object
 * — `{fiveHour, sevenDay, scopedWeekly[], overage, spend, …}` — written by nine
 * producers with nine different merge policies and read by loose field access
 * all over the tree. That object cannot express what the vendors actually send:
 *
 *  (a) B-9213 — MORE THAN ONE LIMIT PER ACCOUNT. The codex app-server pushes a
 *      SEPARATE `rate_limits_updated` per limit, interleaved on one session.
 *      Measured on this instance's own buffers (sess-13, 208 pushes in one
 *      conversation): limitId `codex` (the plan, one 10080-min window, 5 %…
 *      100 %) 32×, `codex_bengalfox` / "GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark" (300-min + 10080-
 *      min, 0 %/0 %) 149×, and `premium` (no windows at all) 27×. All three
 *      were collapsed into ONE cache file, last-writer-wins: the file on disk
 *      while this was written held the Spark limit at 0 %/0 % and the plan
 *      limit was simply GONE. A panel flips 5 %→0 % between renders; a pool
 *      reading it sees headroom that does not exist.
 *  (b) B-8b12 — AN EMPTY WINDOW REPORTS A SLIDING RESET. A window that has not
 *      started answers `resetsAt = now + windowDuration` at EVERY read. Same
 *      corpus, 328 empty-window readings: `resetsAt − (measuredAt + window)`
 *      lands in [−489 s, −8 s], median −40 s, and 144 of 149 consecutive reads
 *      carry a DIFFERENT resetsAt. The panel printed it as a precise reset time
 *      (the owner read it as a banked reset being consumed), EDF would rank it
 *      as the soonest deadline forever, and auto-resume would arm on it. The
 *      same corpus's 125 genuinely-running readings sit ≥ 1151 s from the full
 *      window and their reset is PINNED (5 distinct values over 129 reads) —
 *      a 662-second dead band, which is what `EMPTY_WINDOW_JITTER_SEC` sits in.
 *  (c) claude's model-scoped cap exists for ONE family (owner: "除了 fable，没有
 *      模型 specific 的用量限制的") and lives in a `scopedWeekly[]` array beside
 *      the plan buckets; codex has no equivalent shape at all. Every reader
 *      special-cased both, so every reader had its own idea of "the account's
 *      remaining" and of "the account's deadline".
 *
 * THE MODEL. One account key holds a LIMIT SET: a list of LIMITS, each with its
 * own id, scope, provenance and WINDOWS. Nothing collapses; a producer that
 * knows about one limit updates one limit (`mergeLimitSets`); every reader asks
 * the SAME accessor which limit governs the model it is about to spend on
 * (`limitFor`), and `remaining()` / `deadline()` refuse to count a window that
 * has not started.
 *
 *   { identity, fetchedAt, source, limits: [ {
 *       limitId, name, scope:'plan'|'model'|'credits'|'overage',
 *       model, family,
 *       windows: [ { kind:'5h'|'7d'|'monthly'|<other>, minutes, usedPct,
 *                    resetsAt, state:'running'|'empty'|'unknown', measuredAt } ],
 *       flags: { reached, spendControl, overageInUse },
 *       source, fetchedAt } ],
 *     extra }                      // opaque harness fields the legacy view carries
 *
 * WHY IT IS PURE. Three consumers need the identical rules and only one of them
 * has a checkout: the orchestrator (write path, pool, panels), the browser
 * bundle (the three quota panels), and — like `reading-lag.js` before it — the
 * shipped statusline capture tool, which is a SINGLE FILE on hosts with no
 * `src/`. A rule with an import is a rule that cannot be mirrored.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE MAY NOT DO. It never reads a file, never names an account by
 * inference, and never invents a window: a payload that states nothing produces
 * `state:'unknown'`, which every consumer must treat as "no claim" — never as
 * zero, never as full. (`P6`, docs/design-account-hardening.md §3.)

// ── remaining / deadline: TWO QUESTIONS, TWO PREDICATES ─────────────────────
//
// A WINDOW THAT HAS NOT STARTED ANSWERS THEM DIFFERENTLY, AND r3 GAVE BOTH THE
// SAME ANSWER (the r4 verifier's finding, reproduced end to end).
//
//   "WHEN DOES THIS BUDGET END?"  An empty window has no answer. Its reset is
//       `now + duration` on every read (B-8b12: 144 distinct "reset times"
//       across 149 consecutive reads of one bucket), so ranking on it makes it
//       the earliest deadline forever and arms auto-resume on a number that
//       will have moved by the time it fires. `bucketCounts`/`countingWindows`
//       exist for this question and are UNCHANGED — deadline(), weeklyDeadline,
//       the anchor stream, the window fingerprint and auto-resume's arm all ask
//       it, and all of them are right to drop an empty window.
//
//   "HOW MUCH IS LEFT?"  An empty window has a precise answer: ALL of it. The
//       vendor stated a spend of 0 %. Dropping that turns a definite claim into
//       ignorance — and ignorance is not neutral here, it is `known:false`,
//       which the pool ranks at UNKNOWN_REMAINING_PCT (50) and `quotaVerdict`
//       reports as "no usage data" (`usable:null`).
//
// MEASURED HARM OF COLLAPSING THEM. A brand-new claude account whose panel says
// "0 % used" on both plan buckets — the ordinary shape, because the `· resets`
// clause of a panel line is optional and `refreshViaCliPanel` deliberately
// refuses to project the 5-hour one — read back as "no usage data": remaining
// 100 %/known → null/unknown, `quotaVerdict` usable true → null, `rankPoolMembers`
// eff 100 → 50, and `decidePoolSwitch` off an EXHAUSTED member (4 % left) went
// from `to:'new' reason:'exhausted'` to `to:null reason:'no-settleable'`. That
// is a REGRESSION against the base commit and it is money: the pool keeps
// spending on a spent member while a fully free one sits beside it. Running
// this branch's OWN migration over a copy of this instance's usage-cache
// (12 scanned / 12 stamped / 31 limits / idempotent) flips exactly one of the
// twelve files — `__global_codex__.json`, the one whose every window is fresh,
// i.e. the measured B-8b12 shape — from usable to "no usage data".
//
// AND INCLUDING THEM CANNOT MAKE AN ACCOUNT LOOK BETTER THAN IT IS: `remaining`
// is a MIN over every applicable window, so a window at 100 % free can never
// lift another limit's 5 %. It can only change `known:false` → `known:true`.
// That is what B-9213 was actually about — a Spark push OVERWRITING the plan
// limit — and the per-limit merge is what fixes it, not this filter. §⑫'s own
// negative control has said so since r1: "an empty bucket is 100 % free, so it
// never HID an exhaustion — the harm was always the deadline".
//
// HONEST BOUNDARY. A file holding ONLY an empty limit — which is exactly what
// B-9213 left behind on this instance's `__global_codex__.json`, the plan limit
// overwritten away — therefore reads USABLE. That is the pre-model behaviour
// restored, not a new claim: it is what every release before this branch
// answered, and `known:false` was never protection (the pool ranks an unknown
// member at UNKNOWN_REMAINING_PCT and still offers it, while `quotaVerdictFor`
// reports the whole POOL blocked). The thing that actually repairs that file is
// the per-limit merge plus the backfill: the first real plan push restores the
// plan limit and it binds from then on.

// RETIRE a limit the file holds and this read did not name — and r5 gated it on
// `u.scopedWeekly?.length`, i.e. on THE LIST BEING NON-EMPTY. That is a fact
// about the array, not about the parse: it says a model cap was seen, never
// that ALL of them were. Three different parsers feed those seven call sites
// and they do not agree with each other on one vendor state (measured, one
// account: plan 20/20 + Fable 10 % + a `seven_day_opus` at 100 % stated with no
// `resets_at`):
//
//   parseCliUsageText     → plan, model:fable, model:opus   (the ⟳ panel rung)
//   parseOAuthUsage       → plan, model:fable               (the bare-token ⟳ + the four host legs)
//   parseGetUsageResponse → plan, model:fable               (the engine's control-channel probe)
//
// So six of the seven sites RETIRED a real, spent model cap on the strength of
// a parse that could never have seen it: `accountRemaining` went 0 → 80 and the
// pool spent on an account whose Opus was gone — inc-msof8i22 re-opened by the
// very mechanism meant to end its mirror image. Reachability is structural, not
// incidental: the control-channel probe is the FIRST rung of the ⟳ route, ahead
// of the panel, so on any account with a live local claude chat session the
// authoritative list always came from a parser that omits reset-less named caps.
//
// COMPLETENESS IS A PROPERTY THE PARSE STATES, NOT ONE THE ARRAY IMPLIES. Each
// producer counts what it DROPPED — an entry it could not name, a bucket-shaped
// field it could not read a number from, a panel line its own regex did not
// match — and only a parse that dropped nothing may claim the scope.
//
// IT IS A FACT ABOUT ONE READ AND MUST NEVER BE STORED. This store's oldest law
// (the established-window incident): a fact only ONE producer may state does
// not belong in the object all the others rewrite. So the mark is a
// NON-ENUMERABLE, SYMBOL-KEYED own property of the parse result:
//   • `JSON.stringify` drops it, a spread drops it, a preserve-merge of a
//     stored file drops it — and every one of those losses means "no

//     reset IS the same lane;
//   ③ several candidates ⇒ the caller's HINT (the session's request-model
//     family: the bucket is per-model and the response is for that request)
//     breaks the tie; a hint that names none of them decides nothing;
//   ④ NOTHING names it ⇒ the placeholder `model:cap` / "Model cap", family
//     null: a scoped limit like any other (it counts for the account-level
//     min, which is the conservative direction), NEVER written into the plan,
//     and folded into the named lane the moment one shows up with the same
//     reset (a panel, a banner) — `foldPlaceholderCap`, run by every merge.

 *  instance while writing this, `usage-cache/__global_codex__.json` held the
 *  `GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark` model limit and a `credits` limit and NOTHING ELSE —
 *  the plan limit had been overwritten away by B-9213 before the typed model
 *  existed to stop it. Projecting "the plan limit" there yields nothing, and a
 *  view that yields nothing DELETES the only numbers the file had (the write
 *  path clears a legacy bucket the view does not carry, so that a stale bucket
 *  can never outlive the model). The migration measurement caught exactly that:
 *  two real buckets on that file went to `undefined`, which every unmigrated
 *  reader — the pool, the panels, auto-resume — reads as "no reading".
 *
 *  So the fallback is the freshest limit that actually reports a plan-shaped
 *  window. That is not a guess: it is precisely what a legacy reader saw on

  // projection and `fiveHour` was read off the plan limit alone. So a model cap
  // 90 % through its burst window simply vanished from the derived view, and
  // `account-pool-auto` reads the VIEW, not the accessor: measured on the two
  // real codex push shapes from this instance's buffers (plan 7d 33 %,
  // `codex_bengalfox`/"GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark" 5h 90 % + 7d 10 %), the accessor
  // answered 10 % remaining and the pool answered 67 % — a 57-point drift at
  // the exact seam B-9213 is about, and a REGRESSION: the base commit's
  // last-writer-wins collapse happened to keep the Spark 5h and answered 10 %.
  //
  // `fiveHour` therefore means what every reader has always used it for — THE
  // BINDING BURST CONSTRAINT ON THIS ACCOUNT — i.e. the min over every counting
  // 5-hour window in the set. One rule, no backend branch: claude's model caps
  // are weekly-only, so this can only ever pick the plan window there, and the
  // codex case is the one that has more than one. Windows that make no claim
  // are not candidates (an empty or unknown window cannot be "the binding
  // constraint"), and with no counting 5h window anywhere the plan's own bucket
  // is still emitted verbatim — the panel must keep seeing a limit the vendor
  // reported, marked with its state.
  //
  // RANKED BY REMAINING, NOT BY `usedPct` — AND THAT NEEDS THE CLOCK. A window
  // whose reset has PASSED rolled over since we read it, so its stale
  // utilization means nothing and it is FULL: that is `windowRemaining`'s rule
  // and `bucketRemaining` (the pool's) applies it to whatever bucket we emit.
  // Ranking on the raw percentage therefore let a 90 %-spent-but-rolled-over
  // model window DISPLACE a plan window with a real 50 % left, and the view
  // came out MORE optimistic than the set — the exact defect this projection
  // exists to prevent, in the fix for it (found by driving the property with a
  // passed reset; measured accessor 50 % vs pool 90 %). `nowSec` is the same
  // clock `remaining()`/`deadline()` take, so the invariant holds by
  // construction rather than by a second, weaker ordering.
  // THE PLAN WINDOW IS SEEDED FIRST AND WINS EVERY TIE. This field has always
  // meant the plan limit's burst window; another limit takes the slot only when
  // it is STRICTLY more constrained, which is the whole and only claim being
  // made here. (Ranking without the seed made ties fall to iteration order —

// incident reads like this (identities anonymised, times UTC):
//
//   ident-604088  23:43  on-demand         5h u=0.91  resets 00:19   ← its own
//                 23:46  rate-limit-event  5h u=1     resets 00:20   ← its own
//                 23:48  WALL              5h u=1     resets 03:30   ← FOREIGN
//                 23:53  on-demand         5h u=1     resets 00:20   ← restored
//   ident-e65fd1  23:42  on-demand         5h u=0.84  resets 03:30   ← ITS own
//                 23:47  rate-limit-event  5h u=0.84  resets 03:30
//
// The pool re-pointed that session's credential link twice inside ONE turn
// (23:44:48, 23:46:00, 23:46:36 — all three rows are in slot-transitions.jsonl,
// per session, with timestamps). The CLI re-read the credentials (2.1.257's
// mtime-gated `rpe()`) and its NEXT request — made with the member we had just
// moved TO — was rejected. `rejectionSlotFor` answers with the TURN PIN, i.e.
// the member the turn STARTED on, so the wall was written onto ident-604088:
// its panel read "resets 8:30pm" until the owner refreshed by hand, and it was
// demoted for three hours on another member's wall (a usable member excluded —
// this is money, not cosmetics).
//
// WHY THE EXISTING GUARD COULD NOT CATCH IT. `guardReadingTarget` (reading-lag
// rule ②) judges by the WEEKLY window only — 2.369.73 r2 measured that a
// five-hour reset names a TIME and not an ACCOUNT (47 distinct 5h resets shared
// across identities because they snap to the clock). That refutation stands and
// this rule does not touch it: the 5h window is still never asked WHO.
//
// WHAT IS SOUND, AND IS ALL THIS RULE CLAIMS. A window that is RUNNING cannot
// change its reset before it ends. So a stated reset that contradicts the
// target's own still-future window REFUTES that target — it does not identify
// anybody. Refutation needs no uniqueness, which is exactly why the r2
// measurement does not bite here.
//
// BUT NOT EVERY WINDOW REFUTES EQUALLY WELL, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS MEASURED
// (r2, the round-1 verifier's second finding — round 1 asserted the residue was
// small and cited a number measured on a DIFFERENT quantity: the drift between
// two CONSECUTIVE readings seconds apart, not the drift between a reading and
// its account's own on-demand stamp, which is what this rule actually compares
// and which can be hours old). Re-measured with the predicate the rule uses,
// over every claude anchor stream on this instance (7798 rows, the empty-window
// fence already applied, each account judged against its OWN last `on-demand`
// stamp — the only producer that writes the `.window-` sidecar):
//
//                       judged   refuted   of the refuted: states ANOTHER
//                                          account's own window at that instant
//   7d   own producer     4109      0        —
//        session prod.    1160      0        —
//   scoped own producer   4029      0        —
//        session prod.     700      0        —
//   5h   own producer     1706     13 0.76%  —
//        session prod.    1055    137 12.99%  101 = 73.72 %
//
// Read that table carefully, because it says two different things:
//
//  · A WEEKLY window (7d and every model-scoped bucket) never once contradicted
//    its own account, in 9998 judged readings across seven identities and a
//    month. It is a DECISIVE refuter, which is the same conclusion 2.369.73 r2
//    reached from the other direction when it made the weekly phase the only
//    identity evidence.
//  · A FIVE-HOUR window is EVIDENCE, not proof. Three quarters of the readings
//    it refutes state another account's own window at that very instant — those
//    are true positives, mis-filings of exactly the kind this rule exists to
//    catch — but a residue remains, and the honest bound on it is the OWN
//    PRODUCER row: 13 readings where an account's own `/usage` panel, which
//    cannot be mis-filed (its key and its credential dir are one decision),
//    stated a 5h reset its own previous stamp contradicts. Inspected, all 13 are
//    one account alternating A-B-A-B between two resets 90 minutes apart at a
//    constant 0.89 utilization — which is not "a window moved" but B-9213 in the
//    plan bucket: more than one limit collapsed into one field. Until that is
//    modelled per limit end to end we do not get to call the residue zero.
//
// THEREFORE, REFUTATION HAS A STRENGTH, AND IT IS THE WINDOW KIND'S (see
// `refutationStrength`). A weekly refutation may REFUSE the write on its own. A
// five-hour refutation may only CORROBORATE an identification the ledger made
// independently; on its own it leaves the pin exactly where it was and SAYS so.
// The asymmetry is the point: refusing a wall is not free either — an
// exhaustion mark that never lands means the pool keeps sending turns to a
// member the CLI has just refused, which is the same money in the other
// direction, and it is what `guardReadingTarget` warned about when it exempted
// walls in the first place. A 13 % false-refusal rate on 5h walls would have
// bought the panel fix with a new leak.
//
// THEREFORE: TWO INDEPENDENT WITNESSES. The identification comes from the
// LEDGER — `slotAt(sessionKeys, signal.at)`, our own first-class record of
// which member held that link at the instant the rejection arrived — and the
// window is only allowed to CORROBORATE it. Both must agree before a byte
// moves; either one silent leaves the turn pin exactly where it is. In the
// incident they agree unambiguously, from two unrelated stores.
//
// A WALL MAY NEVER OVERWRITE A MEMBER'S OWN ESTABLISHED WINDOW: when this rule
// says 'archive' the write does not happen at all, and no path here stamps a
// window sidecar (only the on-demand panel does, and that is deliberate —
// 2.369.73 r2 moved the established window OUT of the object every producer
// rewrites for precisely this reason).
