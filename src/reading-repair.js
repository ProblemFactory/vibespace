// READINGS-BY-SLOT DATA REPAIR (2026-09-07) — the root-cause cleanup for the
// entries the refuted attribution rule wrote.
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG. Every VALUE reading was keyed by the OTel-observed org =
// the identity the CLI cached in its config dir at SPAWN. A pool hot switch
// re-points the credential link and the running CLI re-reads it, so after any
// switch a session's readings were filed under the account it STARTED on. On
// this instance the visible symptom was a member whose login was WIPED on
// 2026-09-03T05:55Z still receiving limit-banner marks and Fable-bucket
// readings on 09-07 — five days of another account's numbers. The silent
// symptom is worse and has no visible tell: between two logged-in members the
// numbers simply land on the wrong one, poisoning both panels, both anchor
// streams and the learned rates.
//
// WHAT WE CAN PROVE, AFTERWARDS. Three evidence sources, in strength order:
//   ① the SLOT-TRANSITION LEDGER (data/slot-transitions.jsonl) — exact, but it
//      starts empty with this release, so it can only speak for entries
//      written from now on (and for anything backfilled, see ③). Used first
//      wherever an entry names a session.
//   ② each member's LAST-KNOWN-GOOD marker (src/login-state.js): a credential
//      file that is wiped/expired records WHEN it stopped being able to
//      produce anything. An entry filed on that member with a later timestamp
//      is PROVABLY foreign — no inference, no heuristic.
//   ③ an operator-provided frozen journal (`data/pool-journal.log`, or any
//      data/archive/pool-journal*.log): the engine's own
//      "[pool] per-session switch <pool>/<sid>: <from> → <to>" and
//      "[pool] auto-switch <pool>: <from> → <to>" lines, backfilled into ①.
//      Optional by construction — journalctl is not readable at boot.
//
// RULES. Archive, never destroy (data/archive/…); every archived entry carries
// a REASON; an entry that cannot be re-attributed is archived rather than
// silently kept; idempotent (a second run finds nothing left to do) and
// restart-safe (each store is rewritten atomically, tmp+rename).

// ── ④ THE WINDOW REPAIR (inc-mts8a8mr-ulmm, 2026-09-08) ─────────────────────
// The 2026-09-07 repair could only act where a member's own credential file
// DATED its death — on this instance that was ONE member (`members:1` in the
// migration's own log), so every entry mis-filed BETWEEN TWO LOGGED-IN members
// survived it, invisible by construction: that is the "silent half" its own
// header names.
//
// The reading itself carries the evidence that repair lacked. A weekly reset is
// an account property — measured over this instance's whole corpus (6 634
// anchors, 30 days, 7 live subscriptions) each identity has exactly ONE weekly
// reset phase, stable across the period, and the seven are all distinct; a roll
// moves `resetsAt` by exactly one week, so the PHASE survives it. An entry
// whose weekly phase is not its stream's is therefore provably not that
// account's, whatever the account's login was doing at the time.
//
// STRICTLY EVIDENCE-LED, like ②: an identity establishes its window only from
// its OWN on-demand (panel) readings — the producer whose key and credential
// dir are one decision — and only with enough of them to be a fact rather than
// a coincidence. Candidates for RE-FILING are further restricted to identities
// whose account is still on the roster: a removed subscription cannot receive
// readings, and on this instance one removed account shares PandyMax's weekly
// phase, which would make every genuinely re-filable entry ambiguous.

 *  re-filed entry; every stream is still a SUBJECT of the check.
 *
 *  THE SCOPED HALF IS EVIDENCE TOO (r4, reproduced on a copy of this instance).
 *  The first spelling established only `{sevenDay, fiveHour:null, scoped:{}}` —
 *  it THREW AWAY the model-scoped weekly buckets, which are the other half of
 *  what a reading states about itself. That is not a smaller check, it is a
 *  BLIND one: 444 of this instance's anchors carry a foreign 7d ON TOP OF the

 *  it rewrites {5h,7d} from its payload and PRESERVES the file's existing
 *  scopedWeekly), so deciding on the 7d alone moved 443 records — Fable bucket
 *  and all — onto an account whose Fable window they contradict, and
 *  `repairCachesByWindow` then rebuilt a cache from one of them. The repair
 *  was manufacturing the 2.305.0 scoped-bucket misattribution it exists to
 *  clean up.
 *  Measured on the same corpus, a scoped weekly is exactly as much of an
 *  account fingerprint as the 7d: every identity's own on-demand Fable phase
 *  is its own 7d phase (32340/32400, 532740/532800, 320340/320400/320399,
 *  143940/144000/143999, 557999/558000, 579540/579600, 493140/493200 — every
 *  cluster inside the ±120 s tolerance), and the seven are distinct. So each
 *  scoped bucket gets the SAME evidence-led treatment as the 7d: its own
 *  histogram over the stream's own panel readings, and it establishes nothing

 *

 *  An anchor is a snapshot of a usage-cache FILE, and that file is written by
 *  more than one producer: the statusline rewrites {5h, 7d} from its own
 *  payload and PRESERVES whatever `scopedWeekly` the file already held (it has
 *  no scoped buckets of its own — the 2.70.0 Fable-vanishing rule). So a
 *  reading that landed on the wrong key before the window guard existed leaves
 *  a record that is ITSELF A MIX: another account's 7d sitting on top of this
 *  stream's own Fable bucket. Measured here: 444 such records, against 32 whose
 *  halves are both foreign and 4466 clean ones. Handing the whole window to
 *  `decideReadingTarget` decided on the 7d alone (the scoped half could not
 *  even be compared, because `establishedWindows` was discarding it) and moved
 *  443 records — Fable bucket and all — onto an account whose Fable window they
 *  contradict; `repairCachesByWindow` then rebuilt a cache from one of them and
 *  wrote another member's model-scoped bucket, `resetsAt` and `scopedFetchedAt`
 *  over the target's own. `accountRemaining` / `weeklyDeadline` / `bucketRems`
 *  all read `cache.scopedWeekly`, so the repair was manufacturing exactly the
 *  2.305.0 scoped-bucket misattribution it exists to clean up.
 *
 *  Each bucket is therefore disposed of BY ITS OWN EVIDENCE:
 *    · the PRIMARY half is {5h, 7d} — one payload, one producer, one
 *      credential — so the 5h travels with the 7d and never alone (a 5-hour
 *      window names a TIME, not an account, and can prove nothing by itself);
 *    · every scoped weekly bucket is judged on its own phase;
 *    · the RECORD follows its primary half, and carries ONLY the buckets that
 *      agree with wherever it lands. Every other bucket is archived with its
 *      own reason — the archive line keeps the ORIGINAL WHOLE RECORD, so
 *      nothing is destroyed and the offline corpus can still re-derive it;
 *    · a record with no agreeing bucket at all is archived, not moved. */

/** EVERY usage-cache FILE THE PRODUCT ACCEPTS, resolved to the identity whose
 *  readings it holds (r5, reproduced on a copy of this instance's stores).
 *
 *  r4 keyed the cache half on ONE account per stream — `w.accountId`, the most
 *  frequent `accountId` among the stream's rows — and that is not the same
 *  question as "which cache files are this identity's". An org-merged login
 *  surfaces as BOTH `__global__.json` (the machine login) and the named
 *  subscription, and `usageIdentityGroups` puts them in ONE group precisely
 *  because they are one quota; on this instance `usage-cache/__global__.json`
 *  carries the same `orgUuid` as its named sibling and that identity's stream
 *  holds 47 rows keyed to it. Being invisible here had three consequences, all
 *  silent: it was never repaired, so a foreign window in it survived the
 *  migration; it was never SEEDED, so `guardReadingTarget` — whose `windows`
 *  map is keyed by CACHE FILE NAME — had no entry for `__global__` and was
 *  structurally inert on it, writing whatever bookkeeping asked; and because
 *  `sweepUsageAnchors` anchors the FRESHEST cache of a group, one sweep of a
 *  foreign `__global__.json` re-poisons the stream the migration just cleaned.
 *
 *  So the files are ENUMERATED with the product's own predicate and each is
 *  resolved with the product's own rule:
 *    · FORWARD (`identityKeyFor` over the file itself, plus the roster's
 *      backend/type/email exactly as `usageIdentityGroups` reads them) — this
 *      is the live answer and it WINS whenever it names an identity;
 *    · the `acct:` fallback is `identityKeyFor`'s own documented LAST RESORT,
 *      i.e. the file states no org and no email. The engine can still key such
 *      an account by email because `accounts.list()` reads it out of the
 *      CREDENTIAL DIR, which this migration (running before any AccountManager
 *      exists) cannot; two live members here are in exactly that state. Their
 *      own stream names them in `accountId`, written beside `identityKey` from
 *      the SAME group at the SAME moment, so it is the historical forward
 *      answer rather than a guess — and it can only be used when exactly ONE
 *      established stream names the account. A reassignment cannot sneak
 *      through it: a login that moved orgs writes the new `orgUuid` into the
 *      file, and the forward rung reads that first.
 *  Pseudo keys are deliberately excluded from the fallback index: the engine
 *  records `accountId: null` for BOTH `__global__.json` and
 *  `__global_codex__.json`, so a null row cannot tell the two apart (measured:
 *  the codex stream's 1532 rows are null-keyed exactly like a claude machine
 *  login's would be). Both are named by the forward rung anyway.
 *  `host-*` is excluded for the same reason the engine excludes it from
 *  identity groups: `usage-cache/host-<id>.json` is that HOST's own claude
 *  login, no anchor stream describes it, and this migration therefore has no
 *  established window to judge or seed it with. */

 *  login's snapshot is persisted TWICE: `usage-cache/__global__.json` (written
 *  by the statusline hook and the on-demand refresh) and `data/usage-cache.json`
 *  — the boot seed of `_rateLimitCache`, whose `.claude` payload is the SAME
 *  `__global__` slot (`USAGE_CACHE_FILE`; `readUsageCache` at the top of
 *  usage-routes reads it, `writeUsageCache` is its only writer, and the
 *  same-account merge at usage-routes ~:310-316 writes the NAMED sub's snapshot
 *  into it whenever the two are one quota). r5 never touched that file, and
 *  because the repair REWINDS `fetchedAt` when it rebuilds a snapshot from an
 *  anchor, the untouched copy is GUARANTEED to win the newest-wins merge that
 *  reads it:
 *
 *      if (key === '__global__') {
 *        if (!_rateLimitCache || (u.fetchedAt > (_rateLimitCache.fetchedAt||0)))
 *          { _rateLimitCache = u; writeUsageCache(); }
 *
 *  Measured on a copy of this instance's stores, one frozen snapshot, only the
 *  repair changed: after the r5 migration `usage-cache/__global__.json` and the
 *  named sub are clean (0.53 @ phase 1789142340) while `data/usage-cache.json`
 *  still carries the stranger's 0.93 @ 1789491600 with the newest `fetchedAt`,
 *  and the REAL `/api/usage` then serves 0.93 on BOTH rows — the machine login
 *  from `_rateLimitCache`, and the named subscription because the same-account
 *  merge hands the freshest of the pair to both. The migration is one-shot and
 *  ledger-gated, so nothing runs again to notice.
 *
 *  RESOLVED WITH THE DIRECTORY HALF'S OWN ANSWER. This file is not an identity
 *  of its own; it is a cached copy of the `__global__` KEY, so it is judged by
 *  whatever `identityCacheKeys` said about `__global__` — asking
 *  `identityKeyFor` again over this payload would be a second, weaker spelling
 *  of the map r5 exists to make single. When `__global__` is unresolvable (or
 *  the directory holds no `__global__.json` at all, so the map never names it)
 *  the file is LEFT ALONE and said, exactly as the directory half leaves an
 *  unresolvable key alone: a copy we cannot attribute is not a copy we may
 *  delete.
 *
 *  ARCHIVE, THEN UNLINK — NOT MIRROR. The archive line goes to the same
 *  `readings-window-usage-cache.ndjson` under `store: 'usage-cache.json'`, so
 *  nothing is destroyed; then the file is REMOVED rather than overwritten with
 *  the repaired directory snapshot. Removing is the smaller claim and it is
 *  self-healing on the product's own paths: `readUsageCache()` catches and
 *  returns null, so `_rateLimitCache` starts null and `ingestPassiveUsage`'s
 *  `!_rateLimitCache` branch re-seeds it from the repaired
 *  `usage-cache/__global__.json` on the first tick — which runs synchronously
 *  inside `setupUsage`, so there is no window in which a panel is missing a row
 *  — and if that file was emptied (no surviving own-window reading to rebuild
 *  from) the same-account merge re-seeds it from the named sub of the same
 *  quota. Mirroring instead would make this migration a SECOND WRITER of a
 *  reading snapshot, owing the window filter, the identity fields and the
 *  scoped preserve-merge that `_cacheFromAnchor` carries — a second spelling of
 *  the file we have just written. And whatever re-seeds it afterwards comes
 *  FROM the repaired directory, so its `fetchedAt` can never outrank it again.
 *
 *  ANY contradicting bucket unlinks, not just the 7-day one. The directory half
 *  splits the two shapes (a foreign 7d is rebuilt, a foreign scoped bucket is
 *  stripped in place) because those files hold numbers nothing else has; this
 *  one is a COPY of a file that has just been repaired in both shapes, so the

// The established window (`.window-<key>`) is what the account's /usage PANEL
// last stated — and B-855a showed that panel can be ANOTHER account's: the
// probe took its org context from the machine-wide ~/.claude.json, which every
// session's CLI rewrites. A foreign panel re-stamped the sidecar, and from then
// on the account's OWN readings were refused by the live guard ("refusing to
// write X a reading from another window — archived") with nothing that could
// ever put it right (B-855a ②: the roster showed somebody else's usage, the
// pool called the healthiest Fable member "Fable 2 % < 5 %"). The witness a
// panel cannot fake is the weekly window the account's OWN API responses
// state: a `rate_limit_event` filed on a slot-VALIDATED link. This STANDING
// repair (boot, POST /api/usage/repair-identity, and the one-shot migration
// row so the ledger says it ran) derives each roster account's API PHASE from
// that evidence and makes the stores agree with it. The API phase WINS: a
// sidecar it contradicts is re-stamped (`source:'api'`, `verifiedAt`), a cache
// snapshot it contradicts is archived and rebuilt from the newest anchor that
// agrees wholly, and the own readings the polluted sidecar refused are written
// back through the ONE write path.
//
// EVIDENCE, and why each source is one (measured on this instance 2026-09-17):
//   (a) an anchor written by the `rate-limit-event` producer whose 7-day bucket
//       MOVED against the previous anchor of the same account. An anchor is a
//       snapshot of the whole cache file and a five-hour-only event re-anchors
//       whatever 7d the file already held — on the member the owner felt, 6 of
//       its 12 `rate-limit-event` anchors of the day carried the foreign
//       panel's 7d forward. Requiring the 7d to have moved keeps only values
//       the API itself stated: every member then shows ONE phase at ≥ 95 %.
//   (b) a reading the live guard ARCHIVED to readings-window-mismatch.ndjson
//       with a validated slot (`entry.slot.slotOk`) — exactly the own readings
//       a polluted sidecar refused (128 on that member), each naming the
//       window the API counted it in.
//   (c) the live `.apiwin-<key>` witness c1 writes, when present.
// A phase needs ≥ API_PHASE_MIN_ROWS rows and ≥ API_PHASE_DOMINANCE of the
// histogram (the ±120 s wobble merged by _tallyPhase); thinner or more split
// evidence establishes nothing and the account is left alone, said.
//
// SCOPED BUCKETS ARE JUDGED ON THE 7d PHASE. The API states no `seven_day_fable`
// (the storm essay's measured vocabulary), so the model cap has no API witness
// of its own; but every identity's own Fable phase IS its own 7d phase (r4,
