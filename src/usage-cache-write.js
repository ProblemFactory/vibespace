/**
 * usage-cache-write.js — THE ONE WRITE PATH for data/usage-cache/*.json
 * (docs/design-account-hardening.md §4.2 / P4, with the typed model of
 * src/quota-model.js).
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACES. Nine producers wrote this store, each with its own
 * read-modify-write and its own idea of what a snapshot is:
 *
 *   statusline ingest (shipped tool) · on-demand `claude -p /usage` panel ·
 *   bare-token ⟳ · rate_limit_event capture (+ its sibling fan-out) ·
 *   the wall/limit-banner mark · the codex live app-server push ·
 *   the codex rollout-tail summariser · the remote host-* harvest ·
 *   the repair migration
 *
 * Every one of them rebuilt the whole object, so the store's history is a list
 * of fields that were silently lost because ONE of the nine forgot to carry
 * them forward: `scopedWeekly`, the org identity, `spend`, `corroborated`, and
 * — the one that replayed a live incident — the established window (which is
 * why that fact now lives in a SIDECAR no producer writes). And because the
 * object could hold exactly one set of buckets, codex's three concurrent limits
 * collapsed into whichever pushed last (B-9213).
 *
 * WHAT IT GUARANTEES.
 *  1. **Per-limit merge, never last-writer-wins.** A producer that knows about
 *     one limit updates one limit; the others are carried forward untouched.
 *  2. **The legacy snapshot is a DERIVED VIEW.** `fiveHour` / `sevenDay` /
 *     `scopedWeekly` / `overage` are PROJECTED from the merged `limits` after
 *     every write, so a reader that has not migrated yet still sees a
 *     consistent object — and sees the PLAN limit's numbers, deterministically,
 *     instead of whichever limit spoke last.
 *  3. **A malformed set never lands.** The validator runs on what we are about
 *     to persist; our own producer being wrong is a bug we refuse to write, a
 *     corrupt file already on disk is a fact we heal past (its limits are
 *     dropped, loudly, and the new reading proceeds).
 *  4. **Provenance per limit, and only for what was MEASURED.** `source` and
 *     `fetchedAt` are stamped on the LIMIT, not only on the file, so a panel
 *     showing three limits side by side can say who produced each number and
 *     how old it is — and a limit this write only CARRIED FORWARD keeps the
 *     provenance of the reading that established it (`carryUnmeasuredLimits`).
 *  5. **Only a producer that enumerates may retire.** A limit the file holds
 *     and this write does not name is carried forward — unless the producer
 *     declares itself authoritative over that scope (`authoritativeScopes`),
 *     which exactly one kind of producer can: the one whose own parse listed
 *     the complete set.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not decide WHICH key a reading belongs to. That
 * is the slot/window question and it already has an owner: the caller resolves
 * the key (`readingSlotFor`) and may hand us a `guard` (the engine's
 * `guardReadingTarget`, i.e. src/reading-lag.js ②) which we call before
 * touching anything. Composing, never forking — a second answer to "whose
 * numbers are these" is exactly the defect class this store has already
 * suffered five times.
 *
 * SHARED tier: fs/path + the PURE model + the harness parsers. The daemon can
 * bundle it, and the shipped statusline tool mirrors the RULES it needs
 * (src/reading-lag.js's sentinels) rather than requiring this file.

/**
 * A LIFTED LIMIT WHOSE NUMBERS DID NOT MOVE IS NOT A NEW READING (r5).
 *
 * THE DEFECT. A legacy producer hands us ONE reading spread over a
 * carry-forward of everything else: `captureRateLimitEvent` spreads the
 * identity's freshest file, changes the one bucket its event names, and hands
 * the whole object here. `liftCacheObject` then rebuilds EVERY limit on it with
 * THIS producer's `source` and THIS write's clock, and `mergeLimit` prefers the
 * newer copy — so one `rate_limit_event` about the 5-hour bucket re-stamped the
 * model-scoped Fable cap and the overage limit as "via own session, just now".
 * Reproduced against a copy of this instance's own post-migration cache file:
 * `model:fable` went from `on-demand @ 1788974610137` to
 * `rate-limit-event @ 1788975217500` on a record that says nothing about Fable,
 * and its window's `measuredAt` moved to now while `utilization` stayed 1.
 * The panel rows added to END that class (`limitRows` → "via X · Updated Y")
 * were reading the lie.
 *
 * WHY THE ANSWER IS A DERIVATION AND NOT A LIST. "Which fields did I measure?"
 * asked of each producer is a preserve list, and a preserve list is the single
 * tool that has failed on this store six times (scopedWeekly, the org identity,
 * `spend`, `corroborated`, the established window, `limits`). The file can
 * answer it without being asked: a limit whose CLAIM — its numbers, not its
 * clock (`quotaModel.limitClaimKey`) — is unchanged from what the file already
 * holds is the reading the file already holds, so it keeps that reading's
 * provenance, verbatim.
 *
 * THE DIRECTION IT ERRS IN, DELIBERATELY. A producer that genuinely
 * re-measured a number and got the same value keeps the OLDER age: the row
 * says "measured then" rather than "confirmed now". That is the conservative
 * half — a number that looks staler than it is costs a re-read, while a stale
 * number wearing a fresh timestamp is the sentence the readings-by-slot
 * incident could not survive. The FILE-level `fetchedAt` is untouched by this
 * rule, so freshness-ranked machinery (the anchor sweep, the identity-group
 * "freshest file" base) sees exactly what it saw before.
 *
 * NOT APPLIED TO A TYPED `set`. A producer that builds a LimitSet states
 * exactly the limits it carries — that is what the typed shape is FOR — so
 * there is no carried-forward half to detect and re-deriving one would be a
 * second, weaker answer to a question the producer already answered.

 * limit. But it also means NOBODY can say a limit is gone: a model-scoped cap

 * whose live reading says 80. The base commit answered 80: the producer's list
 * landed verbatim there, so this is a regression of this branch's own making.
 *
 * `replace` is not the answer — it is documented as repair-only and it drops
 * EVERYTHING, including limits this producer never had an opinion about.
 *
 * So the producer says it, and only a producer that can: `authoritativeScopes`
 * is passed exactly where the call site's OWN parse enumerated the complete set
 * (a `/usage` panel that listed model caps lists all of them). A producer that
