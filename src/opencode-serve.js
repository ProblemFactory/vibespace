/**
 * OpenCode serve-mode STORE FACTS (S9 of docs/design-harness-plugins.md §2.4,
 * B-03f2). SHARED tier: node builtins + discovery-facts + the ACP reader only —
 * one implementation of "which OpenCode conversations live on this machine and
 * what do they contain", never an ORCH import.
 *
 * WHY: S8's ACP harness has no transcript files (OpenCode keeps sessions in its
 * own sqlite, ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db), so STOPPED OpenCode
 * conversations never reached the sidebar and could not be resumed from it.
 * `opencode serve` exposes that store over HTTP on 127.0.0.1 (verified
 * 1.18.29, OpenAPI at /doc): session list/get/messages/fork/children/status,
 * plus SSE at /event — this module uses the read family + fork.
 *
 * THREE PIECES:
 *   OpencodeServeClient  — a tiny fetch client (base URL, 1.5s default
 *                          timeout, Basic auth only when OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD
 *                          is set in the spawn env; no vendor secret ever).
 *   createServeLocator   — finds ONE serve instance per VibeSpace: reuse the
 *                          one recorded in data/opencode-serve.json {port,pid,
 *                          startedAt,command,cwd} when it still answers
 *                          /global/health AND its own project is safe,
 *                          else start `opencode serve --port <free>
 *                          --hostname 127.0.0.1` (detached, stdio ignored, under
 *                          the caller's sanitized env, FROM ITS OWN EMPTY
 *                          data/opencode-serve/cwd) and keep it: respawn on
 *                          exit with exponential backoff, PARKED after 5 crashes
 *                          (loud in user actions, silent in the poll), stopped
 *                          on server exit, and STOPPED as a runaway when its
 *                          /proc sample blows the CPU/RSS bounds. Started
 *                          LAZILY on the first discovery and only when the CLI
 *                          is installed AND autostart is on — and autostart is
 *                          DEFAULT OFF (owner decision 2026-09-07): the switch
 *                          is the built-in 'opencode-serve' PLUGIN the user
 *                          enables deliberately (decideAutostart below is the
 *                          ONE decision; src/plugins.js is its control surface,
 *                          this module stays the facts). After boot the
 *                          OpenAPI is probed once: the `fork` capability verdict
 *                          (POST /session/{sessionID}/fork present) is reported
 *                          through onCaps — capsOf('opencode').fork flips ONLY
 *                          on that evidence.
 *   createFacts          — the store contract members the harness descriptor
 *                          exposes: discover({activeSessions}) (10s list cache,
 *                          10s negative cache, every call bounded by the 1.5s
 *                          budget — a hung serve never stalls the 5s
 *                          /api/sessions poll), readConversation(id) for the
 *                          serve-backed reader (8s, LOUD), forkSession(id).
 *
 * WHERE IT RUNS AND WHAT IT MAY TOUCH (2.369.50, the 2.369.42 runaway):
 * OpenCode boots an "instance" per DIRECTORY and each instance recursively
 * indexes + inotify-watches that tree (`fff-*` + `notify-rs` threads).
 * Measured with /proc against a real 1.18.29 serve:
 *   • v1 routes (/session, /session/:id, /session/:id/message, /project) boot
 *     NOTHING; every v2 /api/session/{id}/… route boots an instance for that
 *     session's directory (+19 threads, +200 MB, a full-tree watch).
 *   • the serve's cwd decides its DEFAULT project (git walk UP, else the
 *     'global' catch-all whose worktree is '/'), so the serve runs from its own
 *     empty throwaway git repo under data/opencode-serve/cwd.
 *   • listAllSessions takes the DIRECTORY-LESS listing first and only
 *     bootstraps `scope=project` for real (vcs-backed) worktrees, never '/',
 *     $HOME or the tmp dir.
 * The 2.369.42 shape: the serve ran with cwd=$HOME (project '/') and the naming
 * lookup used the v2 route on a session whose directory was /tmp — 209 CPU-min,
 * 5.0 GB RSS, 30 021 inotify watches, 3.6 GB/s page-cache reads.
 *
 * 'acp-events' SYNTHESIS (messagesToAcpRecords): a stopped conversation is
 * rebuilt as the record stream the wrapper would have journaled, so the
 * existing AcpMessageManager renders it read-only with zero new renderer code:
 *   session                       → {kind:'session', how:'serve', model:'<providerID>/<modelID>', mode:<agent>}
 *   user message  text parts      → {kind:'user', msgId:<message id>, content:[{type:'text'}]}
 *                 file parts      → a "[file: name]" text line inside the same user record
 *   assistant     text part       → update agent_message_chunk (messageId = part id: one card per part)
 *                 reasoning part  → update agent_thought_chunk
 *                 tool part       → update tool_call (kind from the OpenCode tool id, rawInput, locations)
 *                                   + tool_call_update (completed|failed, output/error text, edit diff)
 *                 subtask part    → tool_call kind other (Task: <description>), completed
 *                 compaction part → notice "Context compacted"; retry part → notice "Retry #n: <error>"
 *                 model/agent switch (modelID/mode differ from the previous assistant) → {kind:'config'}
 *                 end of message  → prompt_end (MessageAbortedError → cancelled, other error → error, else end_turn;
 *                                   an assistant message without time.completed and without error = still open, no prompt_end)
 *   step-start / step-finish / snapshot / patch / agent parts → skipped (bookkeeping, nothing to render)
 * OpenCode tool id → ACP ToolKind: read→read; glob|grep|list|ls→search;
 * edit|write|patch|multiedit|apply_patch→edit; bash|shell→execute;
 * webfetch|websearch|codesearch→fetch; todowrite|todoread|plan→think; else other.
 * Tool state → ACP status: pending→pending, running→in_progress, completed→completed, error→failed.
 *
 * NAMING: the shared rule (discovery-facts nameFromText over the FIRST user
 * message) read from the v1 GET /session/:id/message list — which is the WHOLE
 * conversation oldest-first (v1 `limit` returns the NEWEST N, so it cannot page
 * from the front), capped at NAME_MAX_BYTES. The v2 asc endpoint is smaller but
 * BOOTS AN INSTANCE — see above; never use it here. Cached per id, at most
 * NAME_BATCH lookups per discovery tick so a big store names itself
 * progressively without a request burst; fallback = OpenCode's own title unless
 * it is the "New session - <date>" placeholder.
 *
 * WIRED BY THE S9 REMAINDER (B-eac2 — the old "NOT IN SCOPE" list is empty):
 * revert/unrevert, the `question` ask lane, the pty family, and the SSE stream
 * (src/opencode-events.js) which REPLACED the 10s list poll.
 *
 * THE PTY FAMILY SENDS NO `directory` (round 4 — the one place a user
 * directory could still reach the serve). A `?directory=` query is what BOOTS
 * an instance, `DELETE /pty/{id}` frees nothing it booted, and measured on a
 * 200-dir repo that is 204 inotify watches per terminal that outlive every
 * close, vs 4 without it — with an identical shell cwd, because the shell's
 * directory rides the request BODY. See OpencodeServeClient's pty block.
 * A serve pty also OUTLIVES this process, so `reapPtys()` sweeps the ones no
 * session can reach on the ready edge of each serve process.

   *
   *  A pty is addressed by its ptyID, but the pty REGISTRY is per OpenCode
   *  INSTANCE, and `?directory=X` is what picks (and BOOTS) the instance. So a
   *  `directory` query on `POST /pty` bootstraps an instance for the user's

   *  `DELETE /pty/{id}` releases NOTHING but the shell. Measured, same-origin
   *  A/B, fresh serve per arm, target = a 200-dir/4046-file repo, /proc
   *  Threads + `inotify wd` count over /proc/<serve>/fdinfo/*:
   *    with `?directory=`  base[thr,wd]=[16,0] → open#1 [44,204] → close#1
   *                        [41,204] → open/close #2,#3 … [41,204]  (never freed)
   *    without it          base[16,0] → open#1 [45,4] → close#1 [42,4] → …[42,4]
   *  and `readlink /proc/<shell>/cwd` = the target directory in BOTH arms: the
   *  query buys the SHELL nothing (the `cwd` BODY field is what places it), it
   *  only decides which instance owns the registry entry. The only thing that
   *  frees the watches is `POST /instance/dispose` — i.e. the terminal would
   *  have to hold a whole indexed instance for its entire lifetime and dispose
   *  it on close, when it can simply never boot one.
   *
   *  CHANGE THEM TOGETHER OR NOT AT ALL: measured, `PUT /pty/{id}?directory=X`
   *  on a pty created WITHOUT the query answers 404 PtyNotFoundError (and vice

  // BUT IT ONLY RUNS WHILE THE SERVICE DOES (round 5). The lane is a CLIENT of
  // the serve: `start()` arms an fs.watch on the USER's real OpenCode store
  // (resolved from the env THIS server runs under) plus an SSE reconnect loop
  // with its own timers. With the background service OFF — the shipped default
  // since 2026-09-07, where the rule is that NOTHING of ours runs or watches —
  // install() started it anyway at boot, so an unrelated `opencode` process's
  // writes to ~/.local/share/opencode woke a server whose OpenCode feature the
  // user never turned on. So the lane follows ONE predicate:
  //   • the SAME decision the locator spawns on (opts.autostart =
  //     decideAutostart: the ops override, else the plugin record), OR
  //   • a serve is actually READY — which covers the one case that decision
  //     does not: a RECORDED instance we merely ADOPT (allowed with the plugin
  //     off, and once we are talking to it, following it costs nothing new).
  // Enabling the plugin flips the decision AND notifies (locator.start()), so
  // the lane comes up without a restart; disabling stops the process and the
  // lane with it — SSE socket, backoff timer and store watch.
