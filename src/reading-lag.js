/**
 * reading-lag.js — PURE (imports nothing): WHOSE NUMBERS ARE THESE?
 *
 * THE INCIDENT (inc-mts8a8mr-ulmm, 2026-09-08 05:27Z; owner: "a low-usage
 * account suddenly jumped to 93% 7d"). 2.369.68 established the right rule —
 * a reading belongs to the CREDENTIAL SLOT the process was handed, pinned for
 * the turn — and that rule is still right. What it could not know is that the
 * slot moves while requests are IN FLIGHT:
 *
 *   05:27:00  the pool re-points 9 sessions PandyMax → Personal Max
 *   05:27:16  a response to a request made 39 s earlier WITH PANDYMAX'S TOKEN
 *             arrives; `readingSlotFor` resolves the slot at the turn's first
 *             reading = Personal, so PandyMax's 93 % 7d is filed on Personal
 *   05:28:38  the pool reads Personal as "5 % left" and moves everything to
 *             Fish Max — a second switch inside 98 s, caused by our own write
 *   05:29:39  Personal's own /usage panel restores it to 13 %
 *   05:31:40  the pool moves everything back
 *
 * Two false switches, and for 100 s every panel and every anchor stream
 * believed a 13 %-used account was at 93 %.
 *
 * THE EVIDENCE THE RESPONSE CARRIES ABOUT ITSELF. A rate-limit payload names
 * the WINDOW its numbers are counted in, and a weekly window is an ACCOUNT
 * FINGERPRINT: measured over this instance's whole anchor corpus (7 live
 * subscriptions, 30 days, 6 634 anchors) every identity has exactly ONE weekly
 * reset phase, stable across the whole period, and the seven phases are all
 * distinct. A roll moves `resetsAt` by exactly 604 800 s, so the PHASE
 * (resetsAt mod one week) survives it. The ±60 s wobble between the /usage
 * panel's and the event stream's spelling of the SAME window (…340 vs …400) is
 * normal and is what the jitter tolerance is for.
 *
 * So the response can be asked which credentials produced it, and that answer
 * outranks any bookkeeping of ours — the slot, the turn pin, and the OTel
 * observation are all statements about what we BELIEVE the process is reading.
 *
 * TWO RULES LIVE HERE, and they catch the two opposite errors we have now
 * measured on real data:
 *   ① the LAG SHADOW — a reading that arrives after a re-point carrying the
 *      PREVIOUS slot's window is the previous slot's (05:27, above).
 *   ② the WINDOW IDENTITY GUARD — a reading whose window contradicts the
 *      target's own established window is NEVER written to that target; it is
 *      re-filed when exactly one account's window matches, else archived with
 *      the reason. This one also catches the mirror-image defect the same
 *      journal shows at 06:10:46Z, where a turn pin held from before three
 *      re-points filed PandyMax's fresh numbers on Fish Max.
 *
 * R2 — TWO CORRECTIONS, both reproduced against the real corpus before being
 * believed, and both of the same species: a fact was trusted further than the
 * measurement supports it.
 *   (a) WHICH HALF OF A WINDOW IS AN IDENTITY. The rule above is true of the
 *       WEEKLY reset and false of the five-hour one, which names a TIME and
 *       collides across accounts constantly. Asking it made the guard invent
 *       the very misattribution it exists to prevent. `compareWindows` now
 *       decides on the weekly half alone — and therefore needs no clock.
 *   (b) WHERE THAT EVIDENCE MAY BE KEPT. `ownWindow` lived inside the
 *       usage-cache snapshot, which every reading producer rewrites whole, so
 *       ONE ordinary statusline render (8 s cadence) deleted every established
 *       window on the instance and replayed the incident. It now lives in a
 *       sidecar those producers never write (`windowSidecarName`), which is
 *       the difference between remembering to preserve a field and not being
 *       able to lose it.
 *
 * ONE RULE, TWO SPELLINGS. The statusline capture tool (data/bin/vibespace-
 * usage) ships as a SINGLE FILE to checkout-less hosts, so it cannot require
 * this module — it carries a verbatim MIRROR of the block between the
 * `>>> reading-lag mirror` sentinels below, parity-pinned byte-for-byte and
 * functionally by scripts/test-readings-attribution.mjs §13. Its r3 sidecar
 * rule ("the link moved but the numbers did not ⇒ leave them where they were")
 * is the fingerprint clause of `decideLagShadow` — the same rule, now able to
 * answer when the numbers DID move because it can read the windows.

 *  this instance's 30-day corpus has exactly ONE weekly phase, stable across

 *  a TIME: it opens at the account's first request in the block and then snaps
 *  to the clock, so on the same corpus
 *    · a SAME-account 5h reading sits >120 s from that account's own
 *      still-future stamped 5h on 7.2 % (33/456) and 7.4 % (47/639) of the two
 *      busiest streams — a 'differ' about its rightful owner; and

 *      colliding values; `resetsAt mod 1800` piles onto :00/:10/:29/:30) — an
 *      'agree' with a stranger.
 *  Scanned end to end, that rung would have re-filed a legitimate reading onto
 *  another account at 50 real moments. So five-hour is recorded (it is useful
 *  in a fingerprint, and forensics want it) and never asked WHO. A reading
 *  with no weekly component answers 'unknown', and the callers below treat
 *  that as no evidence — which is the honest answer, not a cheap one.

/** ① THE LAG SHADOW. A reading that arrives after the link moved was produced
 *  by whichever credentials the request carried, and a re-point reaches the CLI
 *  on its NEXT request — never the response already in flight.
 *
 *  Evidence order, strongest first:
 *    · the window matches the slot we LEFT and not the one we moved to ⇒ the
 *      previous slot (the 05:27 incident, verbatim);
 *    · the window matches the one we moved to and not the one we left ⇒ the new
 *      slot (the shadow is over — this is what ends it);
 *    · BOUNDED: with the windows silent, a re-point older than `shadowMs`
 *      explains nothing, so a session that never speaks again can never pin a
 *      slot forever;
 *    · neither window decidable (unknown windows, or two members that genuinely
 *      share a weekly phase) ⇒ the r3 statusline clause: numbers identical to
 *      the last ones seen under the previous slot are still those numbers.
 *
 *  THE CLOCK RANKS BELOW THE WINDOWS (r3, reproduced). The bound used to
 *  short-circuit FIRST, above every window rung, and that made the whole rule
 *  only as good as its caller's estimate of the age. The shipped statusline has
 *  no re-point instant in hand and passed the age of its last OBSERVATION
 *  instead, so ONE ordinary render of an idle pooled TERMINAL session — 30 min
 *  since its last redraw, link re-pointed one second ago — answered
 *  `shadow-expired` and filed the previous member's 96 % onto the low-usage
 *  one, replaying the incident including its second false switch, and doing it
 *  in a shape MASTER's unconditional r3 rule had protected.
 *
 *  A clock is a PROXY for "were those credentials still in play"; the window is
 *  the ANSWER. A proxy may never overrule the thing it stands in for, so the
 *  bound now applies only where there is nothing else to go on — which is also
 *  the only place it was ever load-bearing. And `repointAgeMs == null` is
 *  UNKNOWN and does NOT expire: a caller that cannot date the re-point has not
 *  thereby proved the shadow is over (spelling unknown like 'expired' is how
 *  the r3 protection was deleted in the first place). */
