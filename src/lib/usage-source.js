//
// 2026-09-07. Every panel used to say only "Updated 3min ago", which was the
// one sentence the readings-by-slot incident could not survive: a member whose
// login had been WIPED five days earlier showed a freshly-updated panel,
// because a hot-switched session's readings kept being filed under the account
// it was SPAWNED on. The number was real, it just belonged to somebody else.
// So a panel now says WHO produced its latest reading, and a member that
// cannot produce readings at all says so with the age of its last real one.
//
// The `source` values are the ones the writers stamp (rate-limit-capture,
// markLimitBanner, refreshViaCliPanel, data/bin/vibespace-usage, the two codex
// snapshot writers, the wall demotion). An UNKNOWN value is named verbatim
// rather than bucketed — a new producer must be visible, not silently labelled
// "session".
//
// A PRODUCER THAT EXISTS MUST HAVE A NAME (2026-09-07 r3, reproduced): the
// codex writers stamped nothing, so every codex panel said "via unknown — No
// producer recorded this reading" about the only codex producer there is. The
// verbatim-unknown rule is for a producer we have not MET; using it on one we
// ship is the honesty feature lying. The stamp belongs at the write, where the
// channel is known — never inferred here from the shape of the snapshot.
