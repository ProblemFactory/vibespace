   *  normalizer was rebuilt from a transcript that carries no queue record at
   *  all (a publication is a stdout record and the wrapper's stdout is an
   *  800KB RING), so the `[]` it sends is byte-identical whether the wrapper's
   *  queue is empty or holds 25 items. The rows are applied either way (the
   *  wire contract is that an unknown queue always IS the empty list, and
   *  showing nothing for one round trip beats showing a row nobody can act on
   *  — the incident's strip carried an item that had left the queue 58 minutes
   *  and one restart earlier, and clicking ✕ on it only painted it red).
   *
   *  WHAT THE FLAG ACTUALLY GATES is the INFERENCE. On a KNOWN list the bubble
   *  chips are reconciled against it — the normalizer's own server-side rule
   *  (an item that left the queue with no explicit steer/remove RAN), applied
   *  to whatever this client has rendered. On an unknown we learned nothing, so

   *  the NEWEST statement rather than the last-EXECUTED one. Default `now`,

   *  but the epoch-changed re-attach DEFERS its payload by 0-500ms (2.338.0's
   *  render stagger) while the resync THAT SAME ATTACH asked for is answered
   *  in ~10ms, so the payload used to land LAST and overwrite the answer it
   *  provoked. That is the mirror of the ghost row and it is PERMANENT for
   *  that window: the ask is self-limiting (the server now knows its queue, so
   *  it never asks again) — the row is on the wire, in the server, and
   *  nowhere on screen. The same rule covers the known-vs-known twin: a steer
   *  that empties the queue inside the stagger window must not be undone by
   *  the deferred payload's older rows.
   *

  /** THE ONE WRITER of `_queueSupported` — and the reason it exists: the
   *  capability arrives AFTER the bubbles are on screen. loadHistory renders
   *  every message first and calls `_applyLiveMeta` (which carries the attach
   *  payload's `queueSupported`) at the END, and live sessions get the
   *  wrapper's baseline `queue_changed` some frames after the first bubbles.
   *  A chip rendered in between was built with `onSteer = null` ⇒ permanently
   *  `disabled`, and nothing re-rendered it: after ANY history load the
   *  'Queued' chip was dead (round-2 verifier's MAJOR). So a FLIP — in either
   *  direction — re-applies the chips of every rendered message that has a
   *  queueState. The strip has no such problem (it re-renders from
   *  `_setQueue`); the chips live inside bubbles nobody rebuilds.
   *
   *  `at` (2026-09-09 r3) is WHEN THIS STATEMENT ARRIVED — the SAME rule the
   *  rows got in r2, because THE ADVERT REACHES THE STRIP TOO: `_queueCaps()`
   *  collapses to NO_QUEUE_CAPS when this flag is false, and the composer then
   *  renders ZERO rows and HIDES the strip (`queueOps ? this._queue : []`). So
   *  a stale `queueSupported:false` produces the exact outcome r2 exists to
   *  prevent — a real pending message held by the wrapper, present in `_queue`,
   *  and on screen NOWHERE — and the rows' guard one method up cannot see it.
   *  REACHED whenever the attach payload's advert is a NO, which is what the
   *  server answers with no readable LOCAL sidecar (a REMOTE session — its
   *  sidecar lives on ITS machine, as ws-handler says where it asks — or the
   *  2.339.2 resolution-failure class): the advert then falls back to the
   *  IN-BAND publication, which a restart RESETS, so the payload says
   *  `queueSupported:false` while that same wrapper's own publication — ~10ms,
   *  against the 0-500ms render stagger — says true.
   *
   *  ITS OWN STAMP, not `_queueStatedAt`: these are two different facts stated
   *  by different frames, and one clock lets a statement about the ROWS censor
   *  a statement about the ADVERT. `_dropQueueRow` stamps the rows at `now`
   *  from a purely local inference, which would then refuse a later payload's
   *  advert for no reason at all.
   *
   *  AND THE GUARD SITS ABOVE THE NO-CHANGE EARLY RETURN, which is
   *  load-bearing rather than tidy: the wrapper's answer is usually a
   *  no-CHANGE (same process, so the pre-restart view already holds
   *  `supported:true` with the same verbs), so a guard below that return would
   *  never record the answer's instant and the stale payload would still win.

   *  "每次从工作桌面切换到个人桌面就会卡死一段时间": on a switch, every shown
   *  window's content-visibility state re-measures — geometry transits
   *  through sh≈ch, and the paging machinery of 4-6 chat windows went wild
   *  simultaneously: fill-loops, extendTop storms, pin restores — 30-60s
   *  compositor stalls in the field capture). While suspended everything
   *  no-ops; on resume the structural settle window arms (collapsedGeomSkip
   *  covers the re-measure) and a pinned view returns to the tail in ONE hop.
   *
   *  RESUME SETTLE (inc-mtq5bpjt-0o0n, "切换桌面后新桌面的窗口内容跳到历史消息了"):
   *  suspending covered the HIDDEN state, but the resume TRANSITION itself was
   *  unguarded — clearing content-visibility re-measures the subtree, scrollTop
   *  momentarily reads 0 while still pinned, and the gap sentinel's
   *  IntersectionObserver (rootMargin 300px) fired a page-up with zero user
   *  intent. `_resumeSettleUntil` makes every AUTOMATIC paging trigger a no-op
   *  for ~1.2s (the capture's bounce ran +366…+602ms) and the pinned re-tail is
   *  re-asserted once when it expires — the window carries that timer's slack,
   *  and the re-tail asserts off `_pinnedAtSuspend` (the pin as it was when the
   *  window was HIDDEN), so an input-less unpin in between cannot strand the
   *  window in history. A POSITIONING act clears settle AND snapshot.
   *
   *  ROUND 2 — the settle was a one-shot CLIFF and the re-tail was BLIND to
   *  readers who navigate without touching the message list. Now: the re-tail
   *  is a bounded SERIES (RESUME_RETAIL_AT_MS) that bails the moment the
   *  reader positioned the view themselves after the resume
   *  (`_navigatedSince` — wheel/touch/nav key/scrollbar drag, minimap, search
   *  reveal, run-bar landing, any jump), and for RESUME_DISPLACEMENT_MS the
   *  UNPIN itself needs positive evidence (`_resumeDisplacement`).
   *
   *  ROUND 3 — a CLICK IS NOT A POSITIONING ACT. Every message-list listener
   *  ran the full _endResumeSettle(), so a plain left-click/tap during the
   *  settle disarmed the whole repair (window + snapshot + series) and the
   *  resume's own input-less displacement then stranded the window exactly as
   *  in the incident (reproduced with trusted CDP input). The effects are now
   *  split: _noteUserInput (click, non-navigation key) stamps input and ends
   *  the WINDOW; _notePositioning (wheel, touchmove, navigation keys, the

   *  written STRAIGHT TO THE DOM at its origin — `_applyRewound`'s
   *  strike-through, `_onToolsInProgress`'s executing dot — dies at the next
   *  element REPLACEMENT, and there are FOUR places that build an element for
   *  a message (`_onCreateMessage`, the status-transition re-render in
   *  `_onEditMessage`, `_rerenderVisible`, and — round 3 — `_renderGapMsg`,
   *  the huge-session seek renderer in chat-view-seek.js). The claude
   *  tombstone case always gets one: the message it retracts is a STREAMING
   *  partial, and `MessageManager._finalizeStreaming` emits `{op:'edit',
   *  fields:{status:'complete'}}` for exactly that message at the next
   *  `result` — so a retracted answer came back on screen one record later,
   *  while an attach/rebuild (which reads `msg.rewound` from the normalizer)

   *  cannot happen.
   *

   *  the same miss with more copies). One function, called at every place an
   *  element is BUILT FOR A MESSAGE, that asks the VIEW STATE what this
   *  element should be wearing. A new mark is added here and is correct
   *  everywhere. Idempotent — it only ever restates what the state says.
   *
   *  The rule is "built for a message", NOT "enters `_elements`": round 3's
   *  finding was exactly that narrower phrasing — gap-slab elements are
   *  deliberately kept out of `_elements` (they sit outside the virtual
   *  window's accounting), so a hook keyed to that map skipped the one path
   *  that renders a >34MB conversation's earlier history. scripts/

  /** THE ONE application point for the init frame's health facts (§2.6,
   *  round 4) — fed by a LIVE init record AND by chatStatus.initFrame on
   *  attach/HTTP, because the two must AGREE.
   *  Why it cannot live in the init card alone: the card is suppressed for a
   *  `frameRepeat`, and on an attach the init record usually sits hundreds of
   *  records before the tail-50 the window loads. Measured on this instance's
   *  own buffers: 9 conversations carry more than one init, and in 2 of them
   *  (the two largest — i.e. exactly the long-running ones that accumulate MCP
   *  failures) the rendered tail contains an init record and ZERO drawable
   *  cards, so a "{n} not working" strip that a live watcher saw was simply
   *  absent for a window opened later.
   *  ROUND 5 — A REPLAYED RECORD IS NOT NEWS. Round 4 wrote "the chip is not
   *  gated on the slab" and then fed it from the RENDER path, which is exactly
   *  a slab: every batch replay (page-up, teleport, jump-to-bottom rebuild,
   *  reconnect catch-up) re-runs it, so scrolling up past a previous spawn's
   *  init rewrote the present-tense readout — measured both directions, and in
   *  the one that matters a session with a dead MCP server went silent again.
   *  `replay` is the CALLER's statement about the record's provenance (not a
   *  window bound and not a global read), so the rule survives a new feeder:
   *  a replay may not speak, because for replayed records the authority is
   *  applyStatus — the server picks the newest init across the WHOLE record
   *  list, which no page-up can.
   *  ABSENT ≠ CLEAN: no frame ⇒ say nothing (initHealthIssues' own law); a
   *  frame reporting everything connected ⇒ [] ⇒ the chip clears. */

  //       footer is still at/below the top edge. Computed in the scroll rAF
