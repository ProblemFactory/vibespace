// PURE resume-continuity ladder (B-6b6d, owner ruling 2026-09-07 on the known
// residue of 2.369.62 "THE EFFORT A TURN RAN AT").
//
// THE RULE: **a conversation's OWN value wins on resume / fork / restart; the
// instance default (`<prefix>.defaultModel` / `.defaultEffort`) is a NEW-session
// default.** An explicit per-session pick (the card ⚙, Session Properties, the
// New Session dialog's own pickers) still beats both.
//
// Why this exists as a module instead of two `||` chains at the spawn: before
// it, the CLIENT filled the instance default into every create — including
// resumes that carried no pick — so ws-create's continuity fallback
// (`lastCodexTurnEffort`, the whole point of B-21e4 item 4) could never fire,
// and a conversation the owner had set to `ultra` resumed at `xhigh`, with the
// wrapper then synthesizing a `turn_context` that stated the wrong value on
// every message of the session.
//
// TWO FACTS DECIDE, AND THEY ARE ASKED SEPARATELY:
//   `resume`     — is this create a continuation at all (a resumeId rides it:
//                  resume, fork, restart-in-place)?
//   `hasSource`  — can THIS harness recover the knob from the conversation
//                  itself? It is NOT declared twice: the caller derives it from
//                  the harness descriptor's `store.lastTurn<Knob>` hook, so a
//                  harness either ships the reader or it does not
//                  (src/harnesses/*.js). codex has both (its rollout writes a
//                  `turn_context` per turn); claude has the MODEL only (its
//                  transcript names the model that SERVED each assistant
//                  message, and nothing anywhere records the effort a claude
//                  turn ran at — the CLI never reports it back).
//
// THE ASYMMETRY THAT FALLS OUT OF `hasSource`, stated because it looks like an
// omission: on a knob with NO conversation source, a resume sends NOTHING
// rather than the instance default. Falling back there would mean "the instance
// default applies to every resume", which is the defect itself wearing a
// fallback's clothes. With a source that came up EMPTY (a thread resumed before
// its first turn) the instance default is honest — and the caller logs it.
//
// '' IS A STATED CHOICE, undefined IS SILENCE — AND THE DIFFERENCE ONLY
// SURVIVES ON A NEW SESSION (r2 review). The New Session dialog's first option
// IS `''` ("Auto (model default)" / "Default", src/lib/app.js) and it always
// sends a defined string, so collapsing `''` into "no pick" made an explicit
// Auto resolve to the instance default — the user picked "let the agent
// decide" and got `codex.defaultEffort`. On a NEW session `''` therefore wins
// as `{value:'', origin:'chosen'}`, and the client sends the resolved value
// VERBATIM there so the empty string survives the wire.
// On a CONTINUATION the distinction is not available and must not be faked: the
// create message carries `model: sessionModel || undefined` on that path, so an
// explicit Auto and an absent field are the same bytes by the time the server
// sees them — and the per-session config store has always written '' for "no
// override" (session-card.js). A pick of Auto on a resumed conversation
// therefore restores the conversation's own value; the only way to command
// "auto" for real is to change it inside the session.

/** The vocabulary BOTH tiers speak (the client labels these strings in
 *  src/lib/agent-meta.js; nothing else may invent one). */
// `task-group` (agent browser P1, design-agent-browser-v2 §3.2.5): the profile
// pin's third rung — a Task Group's default — is "the user did not state this
// for THIS session", the same claim as `instance` made more specific. Added
// here AND in the client mirror (agent-meta.spawnValueOrigin) in one commit;
// `resumeSpawnPick` itself never emits it (the pin resolves it before calling).
