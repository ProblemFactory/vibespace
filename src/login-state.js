// CREDENTIAL LOGIN STATE — the ONE reader for "is this account's login still
// real, and if not, SINCE WHEN" (SHARED tier: fs read only, no deps, no
// writes, never refreshes).
//
// WHY IT EXISTS (2026-09-07, the readings-by-slot root cause). `parseAuth`
// answers a BOOLEAN (`loggedIn`) and collapses four different states into it:
//   · file gone                          → loggedIn:false
//   · `{claudeAiOauth:{accessToken:""}}`  → loggedIn:false   ← a WIPED login
//   · access token expired, refresh alive → loggedIn:true    ← still usable
//   · access AND refresh both expired     → loggedIn:true    ← NOT usable
// The last row is the satisfiable gap the pool's member filter never closed
// (`poolMembers()` filters on `loggedIn`, so it keeps a doubly-expired
// member), and the second row carries a FACT nothing else on this instance
// has: the moment the login stopped being able to produce a reading. That
// moment is the "last-known-good marker" the readings migration uses to prove
// a cache entry is foreign — on this instance Personal Max's credentials were
// emptied at 2026-09-03T05:55Z and its usage-cache file kept receiving
// limit-banner marks until 09-07, five days of readings from sessions that
// had long been re-pointed to another member.
//
// WHERE THIS LIVES (integration note): a parallel branch introduces
// `src/login-expiry.js` with its own `loginState`. There must be exactly ONE
// implementation — when that branch integrates, `src/login-expiry.js` should
// re-export from HERE (or absorb this file and update the four importers:
// usage-pool-engine, account-usage-routes, migrations, the suite). Two
// predicates that answer "is this login dead" is the twin-set the standing
// sweep exists to kill.

/** THE ACCOUNT-level question — "can this account produce a reading at all?"
 *  — which is NOT the same as the credential FILE question above.
 *
 *  A claude subscription has TWO delivery channels (B-211a): the credential
 *  DIR (CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR → .credentials.json) and a LONG-LIVED
 *  TOKEN minted by `claude setup-token`, which `resolveForSpawn` ships as
 *  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN when the dir has no login (`oatOnly`). Such a
 *  session is a normal, supported, spawnable session: it carries
 *  `_accountId = sub-X` and `VIBESPACE_ACCOUNT_KEY = sub-X`, so its
 *  rate_limit_event / statusline readings land on usage-cache/sub-X.json and
 *  are 100% that account's. Treating "the local credential dir is wiped" as
 *  "this account cannot produce readings" would archive every legitimate
 *  reading it ever wrote and rewind its panel to whatever predates the wipe
 *  (measured on a fixture: a 1h-old reading replaced by a 6-day-old one, its
 *  fresh anchor dropped, the instance's learned rates deleted).
 *
 *  WHO MUST ASK THIS ONE: anything reasoning about READINGS or about what the
 *  panel should claim (reading-repair's death markers, /api/usage `logins`).
 *  WHO MUST NOT: the pool's slot validation. A pooled session's CLI reads
 *  whatever the credential SYMLINK points at, and a token stored in
 *  accounts.json cannot be delivered by re-pointing a symlink — for the SLOT,
 *  the file is the whole answer (usage-pool-engine.memberLoginState keeps
 *  calling `loginState`, deliberately).
 *
 *  @param oatMintedAt when the long-lived token was minted (accounts.json
 *         `oatMintedAt`; null/absent = no token). No decryption needed — the
 *         token's VALUE is irrelevant to this question.
