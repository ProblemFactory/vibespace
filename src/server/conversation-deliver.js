//   1. LOCAL CLI inbox — scan this machine's ~/.claude/sessions registry

//      'peer-post' device op (capability-gated; daemon-first doctrine — no
//      ssh-script twin: any host we deliver to can run the daemon)
//   3. STASH — durable per-conversation queue (data/msg-stash.json), drained
//      into the conversation's next context injection. Machine-agnostic by
//      construction: remote sessions' hooks already call back to this hub.
// Envelope is CHANNEL-READY (owner direction 2026-08-20): every stashed entry
// carries {source, fromName, text, ts} — 'agent' today; Gmail/Lark/Slack
// connectors later feed the same ladder with their own source tags.

   *  wrapper's reply made a real `thread/queue/add` — a billed turn — free.
   *  So a mode-less result settles nothing ('not-ours'); the third one (the
   *  wrapper's own delivery failure) then strands its frame, which is charged
   *  nothing and expires at SETTLE_TTL_MS. The census of those six emitters is
