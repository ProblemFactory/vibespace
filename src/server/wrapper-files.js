/** The wrapper's self-reported CAPABILITIES (2.364.1). The caps marker lives
 *  in the wrapper SIDECAR (<BUFFERS_DIR>/<id>.json — the file chat-wrapper.js
 *  itself writes at boot), looked up through the same collision-aware
 *  resolver as every other sidecar read. NEVER read it from data/session-meta:
 *  that is the SERVER's record and carries no caps — the 2.361.1 gate did
 *  exactly that, so every wrapper tested "old", every >1MB paste was refused
 *  for two releases, and the refusal text sent users to Terminate+Resume
 *  sessions that were already new (owner: three restarts + an update for
 *  nothing). STATELESS by design — callers must not cache a negative verdict
 *  (a wrapper resuming a huge transcript may not have written its sidecar yet).
 *  Returns { frameFile, peerMessage, inputQueue, responseStyle, permissionRules, caps, reason: 'ok'|'no-caps'|'no-sidecar', startedAt, pid }.
 *  permissionRules (owner ruling 10): the RUNNING wrapper serves the READ-ONLY
 *  `read-permission-rules` stdin verb. Same two-gate rule again — the harness
 *  caps row (`permissionRules.liveVerb`) says this KIND of agent answers over
 *  the session, this says THIS process does; a wrapper spawned before the verb
 *  existed would drop the frame without a word (2.361.1/2.364.1).
 *  responseStyle (2.369.58): the RUNNING wrapper serves the `set-response-style`
 *  stdin verb (codex: thread/settings/update). Same two-gate rule as inputQueue —
 *  the harness caps row says the KIND of agent can do it live, this says THIS
 *  process can.
 *  inputQueue (2026-09-06): the RUNNING wrapper publishes `queue_changed` and
 *  serves the `queue-op` stdin verb. backend-caps says what the HARNESS can do;
 *  this says what THIS process can do — a codex session spawned before the
 *  queue/steer release wears the harness capability but would drop the frame
 *  silently (the 2.361.1/2.364.1 skew class), so both gates must pass.
 *  queueResync (2026-09-09): the RUNNING wrapper serves `queue-resync` — it
 *  will re-state its queue on demand, including an EMPTY one. Needed because a
 *  queue publication is a stdout record and stdout is a RING in every wrapper
 *  that owns a queue (800KB, head-dropped): a server that restarts rebuilds a
 *  normalizer that has never seen one, so its `queue: []` is a GUESS. Same
 *  per-PROCESS skew law — an older codex wrapper drops the frame silently and
 *  an older ACP wrapper answers it with a VISIBLE "unknown stdin verb" error
 *  card, so a session whose wrapper does not advert this is never asked.
 *  queueVerbs (verb table, design-harness-features §2.1): WHICH queue verbs
 *  this process serves. A wrapper that adverts `inputQueue` but no list is a
 *  2.369.55-or-older build — it serves exactly LEGACY_QUEUE_VERBS, so the new
 *  verbs are refused for it with a reason while remove/steer keep working
 *  (the skew rule again: an old process must never be asked for a verb it
 *  would drop, and must never lose the verbs it does serve). */
