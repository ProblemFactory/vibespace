// AUTO-CONTINUE AFTER A USAGE LIMIT RESETS (2.368.0, owner request after the
// CLI shipped its own version).
//
// The CLI has this feature, but it lives in the interactive REPL: `/rate-limit-
// options` is not in a stream-json session's command list (verified against a
// real init record) and the timer is a TUI `useInterval`. So a VibeSpace chat
// session hits the limit and just sits there. This module is our own, with the
// same shape — armed → fires at the reset — and one thing the CLI's cannot do:
// it SURVIVES A RESTART (the CLI's own text says "Automatic continue cancelled
// · Claude Code relaunched during the wait"). Ours is persisted and re-armed at
// boot, because a wait measured in HOURS that a deploy silently cancels is
// worse than no feature at all.
//
// ORDER OF PREFERENCE, deliberately: when the account pool has somewhere else
// to go it SWITCHES (usage-pool-engine, unchanged) — that resumes in seconds
// instead of hours. This module is the single-account fallback, so it arms on
// exhaustion and quietly disarms the moment the session produces work again
// (a switch, the user's own prompt, anything): the fire path must never be the
// reason a session starts spending.
//
// SPENDING IS THE RISK, so the gate is explicit at three levels: the global
// default (`claude.autoResumeOnLimit`, default OFF), a per-session value taken
// at spawn, and a live per-session toggle. Firing announces itself in the
// conversation — an unexplained turn that costs money is not acceptable.
//
// GENERIC SINCE 2026-09-08 (owner ruling: "auto resume 应该是通用的, 只要支持
// hook/注入的 harness 都支持, 形式可以不一样 — 有些是发消息, 有些是 start turn
// 之类的固有指令"). Everything in this file is HARNESS-NEUTRAL: the timer, the
// loop breaker, the notices, the tri-state gate, restart survival. Exactly TWO
// facts are harness-specific and BOTH live on the descriptor:
//   the LIMIT SIGNAL  descriptor.quota.signalFromStream — the engine arms from
//                     the classified signal, never from a consumer-local regex
//   the RESUME VERB   descriptor.resume {form, deliver} — 'message' (claude, a
//                     user message on the CLI's chat stdin), 'turn-start'
//                     (codex, the wrapper's app-server RPC lane), 'prompt'
//                     (ACP session/prompt), or null (shell: no agent)
// `capsOf(backend).autoResume` is DERIVED from those two (src/backend-caps.js
// deriveAutoResume, written by the registry at load), and every surface that
// OFFERS or ACTS on auto-resume reads that row — never a backend id.

/** PURE. The line that FOLLOWS a delivered continue. The wording comes from
 *  what actually unblocked us, and there are three ways to know:
 *   · kind 'now'   — the immediate path only ever runs from a pool switch
 *   · the ARM      — the +45s near-arm the pool switch creates. Since the wall
 *                    signals re-point the link BEFORE the session is armed
 *                    (measured: the real producers never reach fireNow), this
 *                    is now the COMMON pool-switch recovery, and it is
 *                    delivered by the timed path — where round 1 said
 *                    "用量上限已重置", i.e. told the user the quota had reset
 *                    when the pool had swapped accounts.
 *   · `moved`      — the pre-fire gate re-pointed the link under us (the
 *                    identity the continue lands on is not the one we
 *                    resolved before the gate): a switch by any other name.
 *   · `cause`      — the caller NAMES it. 'member-usable' is the 2026-09-08
 *                    new-member wake: a member's first reading arrived (a
 *                    login finished, or a human refreshed) and this session
 *                    was ALREADY parked on it, so NOTHING SWITCHED. Saying
 *                    "the pool switched to X" there would be the r2 defect
 *                    again — a card explaining a billed turn must name the
 *                    thing that caused it — and `kind:'now'` can no longer
 *                    stand in for "a pool switch" now that the immediate path
 *                    has a second caller.
 *  Only with none of them is "the limit reset" the reason we continued.
 *
 *  ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, AND `cause` MAY ONLY REFINE IT (r2). `moved` still
 *  outranks `cause`: if the pre-fire gate re-pointed the link under us, the
 *  continue is landing on a member the wake never spoke about, so "the pool
 *  switched to X" is the true sentence — a `cause`-first order would have
 *  named the gate's target as the account that "recovered". Below `cause`,
 *  master's own precedence is restored verbatim: round 1 hoisted the
 *  `/^account usable again/` arm ABOVE `kind === 'now'` and so silently changed
 *  a PRE-EXISTING pair — the engine's near-arm (:1491 "account usable again")
 *  followed by a real pool switch firing with kind:'now' (:2417/:2498) — from
 *  "账号池已切换到 X" to "账号 X 已恢复可用", describing a switch as a recovery.
 *  With `cause` null every one of the eight reachable caller shapes is
 *  byte-identical to master, and test-auto-resume-loop §3 pins the pair. */
