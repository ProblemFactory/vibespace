// LOGIN-EXPIRY WATCH (2026-09-07) — the passive sweep that turns
// src/login-expiry.js's reading of each subscription's credential file into
// exactly three "For you" inbox items per login: 24 h left, 1 h left, expired.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS: until now VibeSpace only reacted AFTER a turn had already
// died — the pool's auth-failure eviction logged "[pool] auth-failure evict …"
// and moved the conversation to another member, so the user saw a dead turn,
// then it "worked again", and nobody was ever told to re-login. The expiry is
// READABLE HOURS IN ADVANCE (claudeAiOauth.refreshTokenExpiresAt is absolute
// and does not move with access-token refreshes), so the honest thing is to
// say it while the user can still act.
//
// §ban-safety: this sweep only READS FILES. No vendor call, no probe, no
// token use — the timer here is the same class as the existing long-lived
// token sweep in server.js (boot + interval, local reads, notice-deduped).
//
// ONCE-PER-THRESHOLD, ACROSS RESTARTS: the decision is the pure
// `reviewWarnings` transition; this module only persists its ledger
// (data/login-expiry.json, atomic tmp+rename like every other store) and
// files the item. A re-login (a different refreshTokenExpiresAt) drops the
// member's ledger, so all three warnings go silent again.
//
// RECOVERY (2026-09-07, measured on this instance): "goes silent again" was
// only half of it. Silencing FUTURE filings does nothing about the items
// ALREADY IN THE INBOX — the owner re-logged two members, their credential
// files carried fresh tokens and a deadline 29 days out, and the "For you"
// panel still listed `Claude login for "Fish Max" is signed out …` as OPEN,
// forever, until someone ticked it off by hand. An inbox item is a claim
// about the world; when the world stops matching it, the thing that filed it
// must retract it. So the ledger now remembers the item IDS it filed for each
// member's deadline, and a real re-login RESOLVES them through the store's own
// setStatus (which saves + broadcasts, so every open client updates live) and
// says so in the journal. Three things it must never do: reopen or re-resolve
// an item the USER already handled, touch an item filed by anything else (an
// agent's vibespace-ask — we only ever act on ids from our own ledger, and we
// re-check the item before touching it), or count a credentials REWRITE that
// keeps the same deadline as a re-login (see `reloggedIn`).

/** The item text for a rung. Includes the ACCOUNT NAME and the EXPIRY TIME

 *  anyway. Text carries the absolute time, not "in 24h", for the same reason:
 *  an item read tomorrow must not lie about when it was written.
 *
 *  BRANCH ON THE STATE, NOT THE RUNG (round-3 verifier). `warnStageFor` maps
 *  BOTH 'expired' and 'logged-out' onto the terminal 'expired' rung — the rung
 *  answers "how urgent", the state answers "what happened". A wiped credential
 *  file is produced by ANY unrecoverable refresh (a revoked or rotated session,
 *  an explicit logout in an isolated dir), not only by the deadline passing,
 *  and the CLI KEEPS refreshTokenExpiresAt when it blanks the tokens — so that
 *  deadline can still be in the FUTURE. Round 1 then filed an `urgent` item
 *  saying the login "expired" at a date weeks out, while the chip on the very
 *  same account row (loginExpiryChipHtml, which does branch on the state)
 *  correctly said "login signed out". Two surfaces, one record, opposite

 *  version of this (deadline − credential-file mtime) reports a healthy
