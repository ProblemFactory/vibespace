// THE SPEND AUTHORIZER'S ORCH HALF (docs/design-account-hardening.md §4.4c,
// P9). The decision is PURE (src/spend-authorizer.js); this module is the only
// thing that reads the ledger off disk, names the identity, asks the usage
// cache about paid overage, writes the journal line, files the inbox item and
// persists the counters across a restart.
//
// TWO PHASE, exactly like the loop breaker's canFire/noteFired: `authorize()`
// answers, `note()` charges. An authorization that never becomes a turn (the
// session died between the gate and the write, the pty refused the frame) must
// not consume budget — and, symmetrically, a turn that DID happen must be
// charged even if the caller then fails to render a card.
//
// …AND THE TWO PHASES ARE NOT ONE INSTANT (r5, reproduced). Whatever a producer
// does in between is invisible to the ledger, so five deliveries dispatched in
// one synchronous pass all read the same pre-charge counts and all five are
// authorized against a cap of two. `authorize()` therefore HOLDS what it
// authorized (`v.hold`, an in-memory reservation that binds exactly like a
// charge) until `note()` converts it, `release()` gives it back, or it times
// out at A.RESERVE_TTL_MS. A hold is deliberately not a stamp: the ladder's
// stash rung — its normal fallback for an unreachable conversation — opens no
// turn, and a charge there would be a turn that never happened.
// HOLDS ARE NOT PERSISTED, on purpose: a restart kills the in-flight
// deliveries they stand for, and a hold that outlived its producer would refuse
// real turns for its whole TTL after every boot.
//
// PERSISTENCE IS THE POINT. `data/spend-budget.json` survives a restart for the
// same reason the armed auto-resume waits do: a release restart that hands the
// automatic spenders a fresh hourly budget is not a ceiling, it is a
// scheduling detail. This instance restarts several times a day.
//
// NO NEW VENDOR SURFACE (§ban-safety): every input is a file we already hold —
// the usage cache the passive capture writes, the credential state reader the
// pool already asks, and our own ledger. scripts/test-vendor-whitelist.mjs
// must stay unchanged by this module.
