// Pooled pseudo-account AUTO-SWITCH decisions (B-6217 v2; EDF ranking v3).

// and acts on the verdict. ZERO API calls anywhere in this path (§ban-safety:
// decisions read data/usage-cache/*.json only — the cache the statusline hook
// / on-demand ⟳ already wrote; auto-switching must never become a scheduled
// quota poll).
//
// Semantics v3 (user-designed, 2026-08-09): quota is a PERISHABLE asset — any
// remaining expires at its window's reset. Drain the member whose weekly
// window resets SOONEST first (earliest-deadline-first): its quota is
// use-it-or-lose-it, while far-reset quota is storable. KEY FACT (user-
// confirmed + cache-verified ±1s): the model-scoped weekly caps (Fable) are
// COMPONENTS of the same 7-day window — same resetsAt — so each account has
// ONE weekly deadline and plain per-account EDF is optimal. The 5h bucket is
// a burst RATE limiter (refills ~33×/week), not a budget: it participates in
// the usability GATE only — ranking on it would degenerate into noise (every
// account's soonest reset would always be its 5h).
//
// Trigger tiers: exhaustion (<5% min-across-buckets) always switches; HOT
// pools additionally switch PROACTIVELY when another member's weekly deadline
// is strictly sooner (hot re-points are free — no restart; cold pools stay
// exhaustion-only because each switch restarts conversations).
