## Project Overview
A backend-agnostic web workspace for **coding agents** — manage many concurrent agent CLI sessions with a tiling window manager, file explorer, and code editor. Each backend (Claude Code, Codex, …) is driven through a `BackendAdapter` (`src/adapters/`); the UI, window manager, chat view, and session layer stay backend-neutral. Sessions run via native agent CLIs inside **dtach** for persistence across server restarts. (Project was "Claude Code WebUI" before the 2026-06-22 rename to VibeSpace — references to the `claude`/Claude Code CLI tool itself are unchanged.)

## How to Build and Run
```bash
# One-line install (checks deps, clones, builds):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProblemFactory/vibespace/master/install.sh | bash

# Or manually:
npm install
npm run build   # esbuild bundles src/client.js → public/bundle.js (~1.8MB)
node server.js  # starts on port 3456 (or PORT env var)
# ./run.sh      # supervised: build once, then respawn on exit (survives an OOM kill)

# PRODUCTION (this machine runs it this way since 2.73.0): systemd USER service
./scripts/install-service.sh        # installs+enables ~/.config/systemd/user/vibespace.service (linger on)
systemctl --user restart vibespace  # THE way to restart after a build — do NOT kill+nohup by hand
./scripts/update.sh                 # pull+install+build+restart in one step (⚙ → Update VibeSpace… runs this in a shell terminal; dtach sessions survive)
journalctl --user -u vibespace -f   # logs (no more /tmp/vibespace-server.log)
# Unit: Restart=always/RestartSec=5 (survives OOM/crash — verified via SIGKILL), OOMScoreAdjust=-500,
# StartLimitIntervalSec=0 (retries forever while the NFS workspace mounts late), **KillMode=process**
# (CRITICAL — the default control-group KillMode killed every dtach session spawned AFTER the service
# migration on each restart, while pre-migration sessions survived; real incident, one session died on
# every restart. Only the node main process may be killed on stop), and baked PATH (node dir +
# ~/.local/bin — systemd's minimal env broke every CLI spawn; real incident). The service does NOT
# build — build at deploy, then restart. dtach sessions survive restarts by design.
```

## Architecture

### ⚑ THE THREE-TIER FINAL FORM (2.319.0) — where a NEW CHANGE goes, and which test gates it

The 2026-08 campaign (docs/design-three-tier.md, R0–R6 + session-brain + closure marathon) reached its terminal shape. Before writing code, route the change:

| The change touches… | It belongs in… | Gated by (run BEFORE commit) |
|---|---|---|
| **Facts about a machine** (discovery, sysinfo, probes, usage walk, transcript parse, ctx sync, writer sweep, shell prelude) | The SHARED module (src/discovery-facts, sysinfo, machine-probes, usage-walker, transcript-service, ctx-sync, writer-sweep, remote-shell) — the daemon bundles it, one implementation runs where the facts live; ssh scripts are FALLBACK RUNGS only | The module's parity suite: test-discovery-interpret / test-sysinfo-op / test-usage-walk-parity / test-transcript-parity / test-ctx-sync / test-writer-sweep / test-remote-shell — a one-sided edit FAILS them |
| **A new device op** | src/agentd/agentd.js handler + capability in the hello-ack + client method. THREE-TOUCH RULE (2.300.0, bit twice): reply carries `op` in the client's id-keyed routing set; unsolicited pushes get their own branch BEFORE prevControl; watches re-arm on reconnect. Reply via `mux.control`, never an invented helper | A real-daemon test (test-sysinfo-op is the template); capability-gate assert (old daemons are never asked — unknown ops HANG) |
| **Live session stdout consumers** (served model, usage odometer, banners, todos…) | `claudeSideEffects` in server.js — ONE implementation fed by the parse AND the device stream through `sbSeenFirst` (parse registers, device fills gaps). Never a new inline consumer in the parse block | test-session-brain-dark (mid parity is suffix-wise — every normalizer prefixes its own session id) |
| **Session creation/supervision** | The daemon pipe-session path (R6, `agentd.localPipeSessions`) is the FINAL form; dtach is the legacy path that dies by attrition. New spawn features go through buildRemoteExec (remote) / the r6Argv seam (local) | test-remote-shell drift guard; test-agentd-session |
| **A one-shot data migration** (reshaping stores on old→new update) | src/server/migrations.js (this instance) or the DEVICE_MIGRATIONS registry in agentd.js (devices, runs at daemon boot/self-upgrade) — BOTH through the shared runner src/migration-runner.js: ledger-keyed run-at-most-once, failed = retry next boot never block, archive-never-destroy, append-only dated ids. Pre-framework one-shots keep their own markers — do not re-register. Wire-compat residue (410s, capability gates, permanent aliases) is NOT migratable — it retires by fleet-telemetry condition, except device-local state which a DEVICE_MIGRATIONS entry can rewrite | scripts/test-migrations.mjs (11) |
| **Quota/vendor calls** | NOWHERE new. Exactly two files may construct vendor requests; the quota-refresh op (human-gated, on the login-holding machine) is the ONE device-side vendor surface. Passive capture (statusline/rate_limit_event/banners) is always preferred. **auto-cli (2.329.0, owner-approved reversal for THIS channel only): a burn-aware background loop may spawn `claude -p /usage` (official binary makes the fetch; zero vendor HTTP from us; idle accounts get a SLOW rung since 2.334.0, owner-directed: per-tick-randomized 30–60min staleness threshold — wandering, never metronomic — + failure exponential backoff; never-read accounts bootstrap through it) — decision=decideCliRefresh (PURE), refresher=usage-routes refreshViaCliPanel, wiring=server.js loop. Do NOT generalize this to raw-token polling** | test-vendor-whitelist (23) FAILS any new vendor call until deliberately allowlisted with its gates |
| **Pool/billing decisions** | src/account-pool-auto.js (pure) + the engine in server.js; per-session links (plan C) resolve via poolCurrentFor(pool, webuiId). Every blocked outcome must SPEAK with named buckets | test-pool-auto (56) + test-account-pool (31) + test-account-verdicts (45) |
| **A server cache a client also caches** | The invalidation entry point must NOTIFY (the 2.309.0 rule) — hook on the ONE entry point, never per call site | test-remote-discovery-dirty's drift guard pattern |

**ACTIVATION SWITCHES (code complete, soak-gated — flip deliberately, in order):** ① watch `sb-parity-hit/miss` in Diagnostics (step-2/3 live parity) → ② `agentd.localDiscovery` on (after `local-disc-snap-ms` looks sane on YOUR storage) → ③ `agentd.localPipeSessions` on (R6 — only after ①② soak; the design's sequencing law). Rollback = flip off; every path falls back structurally.

**ENFORCEMENT (2.323.0; PHYSICAL since 2.325-2.326): the tier rules above are a RED TEST, not prose** — scripts/test-architecture.mjs (47 asserts, runs INSIDE `npm run build` AFTER esbuild — it validates the just-built daemon bundle, and running it first broke every fresh checkout's first build) walks the real require/import graph: PURE imports nothing, SHARED never reaches up, DEVICE pulls only shared+pure, CLIENT crosses only the wire, the daemon bundle carries no orchestrator markers, **and server.js stays ≤2100 lines with ≥14 modules under src/server/ (the SIZE RATCHET)**. Cross-tier edges need an allowlist entry WITH a reason; dead allowlist entries fail the suite. Adding a module = add it to the right tier set in that file (path-based defaults cover src/lib/, src/routes/, src/server/). **拆分P1-P3 (2.325.0-2.326.0) made the separation PHYSICAL**: server.js = bootstrap + wiring stanzas only (6423→~1910 lines; 14 `create(deps)` factory modules under src/server/ — usage-pool-engine, session-stdout, boot-restore, session-brain, account-usage-routes, mounts-plugins-wiring, cli-env, dial-pairing, exit-routes, ops-routes, incident-wiring, sysinfo-wiring, goal-sync, agent-tool-generators); the ws 'create' case family lives in src/ws-create.js behind the VALIDATED `WS_CTX_CONTRACT` (missing dep = loud boot error; scripts/test-ws-contract.mjs pins destructures + call site); every live-session `_field` is registered with an owner in src/session-schema.js (scripts/test-session-schema.mjs fails anonymous new fields). Extraction discipline lives in memory `feedback_no_hacks` (verbatim `create(deps)` factories, lazy getters for late singletons, mutable `let` crosses as explicit `get*()` never a Proxy, worktree-only boot smokes — the repo dir attaches to PRODUCTION dtach sessions, #127 class); scripts/test-restore-smoke.mjs (create→SIGKILL→reboot→reconnect, worktree-isolated) is the cross-seam gate that caught the campaign's one real wiring bug. **Since 2.333.0 it also fires a 28-route GET battery at the live worktree server (any 5xx = fail): a factory function used by server.js but never EXPORTED throws only when the route RUNS — no boot log, no build-gate signal (the /api/agent-hooks 500; third lost-export incident).**

**STANDING SWEEP (the sysinfo lesson, 2.314.0): "twin-sets = 0" is not a state, it's a metric to re-measure.** A user caught a missed local/remote twin AFTER closure. When touching any "how much X" reader, grep for its sibling on the other transport first.


### Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + WebSocket (`ws`) + `node-pty` + dtach
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS (ES modules) bundled with esbuild, xterm.js for terminals, CodeMirror 6 for editor
- **Session persistence**: dtach — claude processes run in dtach sessions, survive server restarts
- **Data persistence**: `data/layouts.json`, `data/session-meta/*.json`, `data/sockets/cw-*`

### Data Flow
```
Terminal mode:
  Browser (xterm.js) ←→ WebSocket ←→ node-pty (dtach -a) ←→ dtach socket ←→ pty-wrapper.js ←→ claude CLI
                                                                                  ↓
                                                                            buffer file (raw PTY)

Chat mode:
  Browser (ChatView) ←→ WebSocket (msg create/edit/meta) ←→ MessageManager ←→ server ←→ chat-wrapper.js ←→ claude --stream-json
                                                                   ↓
                                                          BackendAdapter (swappable)
```

## Cross-cutting laws (the always-loaded digest — full text lives in the kb files)

- **§ban-safety**: NEVER call Anthropic on a timer with a subscription token; vendor requests live in EXACTLY two files (scripts/test-vendor-whitelist.mjs enforces); passive capture is the default; the ONE owner-approved exception is auto-cli (`claude -p /usage`: burn-aware fast rung + owner-directed slow idle rung at a WANDERING 30–60min threshold, never a fixed cadence) — do NOT generalize it. Full: kb-design-lessons §9 + the routing table above.
- **Program-use billing**: sessions run interactive PTY mode — never `-p`/`--print`/Agent SDK for inference (moves usage to metered programmatic billing).
- **Public repo hygiene**: ZERO company/cluster detail, ZERO personal identifiers (users are userL/userW/userN in docs); secret-scan CI + pre-push guard.
- **Worktree-only smokes**: NEVER run server.js/boot smokes from the repo dir — repo data/ is PRODUCTION (#127 class); git worktree + own data/ + symlinked node_modules; harnesses set VIBESPACE_SKIP_AGENT_HOOKS=1.
- **Release discipline**: every change = version bump + CHANGELOG + commit + push; `git push` runs the MANDATORY release gate (`npm run ci` — build + gate suites + ONE real haiku chat turn (oat slot ~/.config/vibespace/ci-oat locally + VIBESPACE_CI_OAT repo secret in Actions — the officially documented setup-token CI channel) + headless-chrome CLIENT boot smoke + worktree server boot smoke w/ route battery, ~1.5min, tracked pre-push hook + GitHub Actions mirror; docs-only pushes skip; `VIBESPACE_SKIP_CI=1` = emergency bypass, use never). Daemon changes also `npm run build:agentd`; user self-updates — no agent-initiated restarts.
- **CS separation**: `hostId` is a PARAMETER, never a branch — one implementation against a machine handle; new facts-about-a-machine code goes in the SHARED modules with a parity suite (routing table above).
- **Multi-client**: every persistent state change broadcasts to other clients live; UI actions chained after a store write must NOT wait for the broadcast echo.
- **Cache invalidation must NOTIFY**: a server cache a client also caches → the invalidation entry point pushes the recomputed RESULT (one dirty signal = one computation).
- **i18n quick rules**: `t()` with ENGLISH-STRING-AS-KEY on human-visible chrome ONLY (never protocol values/stored strings/agent-facing text); keep `escHtml()` around `t()`; sidebar cluster imports `t as tr`; same-spelling-different-meaning ⇒ `tc(ctx,str)`; new keys need zh+ja entries (i18n-check runs in build). Full: kb-design-lessons §16.
- **UI conventions**: theme vars only (no literal colors), `--radius`/`--radius-sm`, createModalShell for dialogs, NO native prompt/alert/confirm, SVG icons only (never emoji), `data-popover` Esc protocol, no global `.hidden`. Full: kb-design-lessons §17.
- **Injection budgets**: hook additionalContext wraps into <persisted-output> at exactly 10 KiB — tools/rules first, logs byte-budgeted last, 9600B hard cap (agent-routes).
- **Spawn hygiene**: agent sessions get `agentEnv()` (sanitized env, never raw process.env); display strings (host-labeled cwds) never reach a spawn; secrets ride env/files, NEVER argv.
- **Danger constants (memorize)**: NEVER delete data/sockets/cw-* (the socket IS the session). Production restart = `systemctl --user restart vibespace` ONLY (KillMode=process is load-bearing — the default killed every dtach session). Restarting the server from inside a Claude session is safe ONLY because of the CLAUDE_CODE_* env sanitizer in server.js (never remove it — silent transcript loss). Buffer/meta sweeps are age-based; kill-path teardown runs BEFORE activeSessions delete.
- **XSS**: NEVER interpolate user/peer-controlled strings into innerHTML unescaped (they sync to ALL clients — one miss = stored XSS fleet-wide); markdown goes through DOMPurify.sanitize(marked.parse()); build image overlays via .src property, never innerHTML.
- **Atomic persistence**: every data/*.json write goes through writeJsonAtomic (tmp+rename); stores flush on SIGINT/SIGTERM — a bare writeFileSync is silent data loss on the exact crash path the product exists to survive.
- **Listener lifecycle**: window-scoped document listeners bind to `winInfo._listenerCtl.signal` (AbortController, aborted on close); per-drag listeners get a per-drag controller — never a per-render one (tears down MID-DRAG).
- **Never block the event loop**: no sync fs/exec against mountpoints, /dav-sharing processes, or discovery sweeps — child processes/workers with timeouts only (three whole-instance outages: FUSE threadpool, execFileSync sweep freeze, device-mount self-deadlock).
- **No silent failures**: a failed USER action must reach the user (toast/dialog/server-notice) — telemetry having it ≠ reported; fetchJson never throws, so callers check `r?.error`.
- **Working mode**: route every change through the three-tier table above (it names the module AND the gating test); fixes go to git only — the user self-updates; bookkeeping via vibespace-status/-task/-ask each turn.

server.js — BOOTSTRAP + WIRING ONLY (~1910 lines since the 2.325.0 拆分; the arch suite RATCHETS it ≤2100). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
src/ws-create.js       — the ws 'create' case family (1633 lines, 拆分P2): new/resume/fork + local/ssh/dial/daemon-pipe spawn + account resolution + breakers + writer sweep + adoption; body wrapped `do{}while(0)` so case-level `break;` semantics survived the move. Deps arrive via the VALIDATED WS_CTX_CONTRACT (ws-handler.js) — missing key = loud boot error; scripts/test-ws-contract.mjs pins contract⇄destructures⇄server.js call site.
src/session-schema.js  — PURE registry of all ~47 live-session `_fields` (owner module + persistence home + note, 拆分P3); scripts/test-session-schema.mjs fails any unregistered new field write and any dead row. New session state ⇒ add the row FIRST.

data/bin/vibespace-docs — full-manual reader for every agent CLI (2.351.0, STATIC tracked, in AGENT_TOOLS): `vibespace-docs [status|ask|task|jobs|msg|pages]`, no topic = global index; fetches GET /api/agent/docs/:topic (vsst_ or jbt_) which serves docs/agent/*-manual.md from the running server's checkout — manuals never drift from the running version; budgeted context teaching carries one pointer line per surface.
data/bin/vibespace-channel.js — EXPERIMENTAL Claude Code channel server (2.344.0, STATIC tracked, dependency-free hand-rolled MCP stdio): declares claude/channel capability; VibeSpace pushes {content,meta} lines to its per-session unix socket (VIBESPACE_CHANNEL_SOCK, data/channel-socks/<webuiId>.sock) → notifications/claude/channel → <channel source="vibespace"> events in the session. Spawned by the CLI itself when agents.vibespaceChannel is ON (per-spawn --mcp-config + --dangerously-load-development-channels server:vibespace — research preview keeps custom channels on the dev flag).

  backend-caps.js — PURE per-backend switching-capability registry (P4切片1, 2.368.21): {pool, hotSwitch: verified|impossible|unverified, planC, sealedOrders, resetCredit, quotaProbe} — 池引擎按能力门控, hotSwitch是实验判定(claude=verified法证三事实; codex=impossible: CODEX_HOME启动canonicalize+token驻内存, 2026-08-24实验); 新backend加一行不加if链; 2.368.26增peerDelivery('cli-inbox'|'rpc-queue'|'stash-only')=互聊活投递通道
  msg-acl.js — PURE reach ACL for agent messaging (Channels v1, 2.362.0): 组内互通 / 组externalVisibility / 会话override只放宽 / 多组并集 / 无组singleton. ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  server/auto-resume.js — 撞限后自动续跑(2.368.0): CLI那套只在TUI(stream-json没有/rate-limit-options), 这是我们自己的且**跨重启存活**(CLI自己重启即取消); 顺序=先让account pool换号(秒级)换不动才arm; 三态门(会话值>claude.autoResumeOnLimit默认关), 不早发/不重复/不在streaming时发/恢复即解除, 续跑用CLI原话; 2.368.27-32 armBestReset: 身份内取**死桶max**(owner抓提前fire: 7d重置≠5h对齐, 健康桶的更早重置不是候选)、跨身份(自己+池兄弟)取min; 热切落到armed会话即fireNow立即续跑, 定时fire先beforeFire跑池评估; limit-banner路径也(re-)arm; 超26h拒绝会在会话内出声(1/h). 同版还有输出风格(Concise等)=spawn时经唯一的--settings设, stream-json不能中途切. ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  server/instance-url.js — 本实例公开地址(2.367.0; 2.367.3 客户端唯一join=utils.absUrl, 地址经/api/home+instance-url广播下发, 严禁再用location.origin拼): 唯一解析者(显式frp映射 > agentd.publicUrl > env > 空)且**映射只是叠加层, 绝不写入设置**(取消映射即回落原值) + 'vibespace-instance' frp代理的唯一发布者(远程agent安装曾在背后发同名代理); 显式映射盖过设置, 安装副作用产生的auto映射只记录不改地址; auth关闭时拒绝发布. UI=Ports面板'This VibeSpace'行. ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  server/design-kit.js — /design画布工具包(2.366.0): 从已安装CLI提取helper+payload(CLI自解压目录优先, 否则二进制流式扫描)+技能文本, 写data/design-kit/<ver>/ 并把第4步改写成vibespace-page publish(全有或全无, 缺锚点=明确不可用), 每次用helper自己--check验证; 状态栏design芯片→可见的design request→agent走kit→发布到本实例. ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  server/published-pages.js — 发布页(2.364.0 接管artifact; 2.366.0 publishContent上传+srcKey=host:path+会话归属+onPublished唯一通知点; 2.366.1 shell/raw分离+compat prelude(randomUUID secure-context坑)+URL只由发问方Host或publicUrl决定): /p/<id>自托管可分享HTML, 默认私有+public锁, srcPath upsert稳定URL, CSP sandbox=同源XSS防线(勿加allow-same-origin). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  server/wrapper-files.js — chat-wrapper文件解析(2.339.2 resolveWrapperFiles: 碰撞会话经/proc argv定位真sidecar) + wrapperCaps(2.364.1: 能力=wrapper SIDECAR data/session-buffers/<id>.json的caps, 唯一读者, 无状态; 严禁从data/session-meta读caps). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  server/conversation-deliver.js — THE conversation delivery ladder (2.362.0): channel socket→local inbox→owning machine's agentd peer-post op→durable stash drained at injection; jobs通知与agent消息同一实现; 2.363.0投递点即渲染peer卡片(emitPeerCard→normalizer.injectPeerCard — server-posted在CLI侧是body-less origin, 只有poster能渲染); 2.368.26 rung1.5=capsOf(backend).peerDelivery=='rpc-queue'经wrapper stdin帧活投递codex(idle=turn/start计费turn, busy=thread/queue/add, wrapper自录user消息故此路不发卡片; ok:false重新入stash). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  job-model.js — PURE Background Work model (2.342.0): schedule math (cron parse/next-fire/jitter/15min agent floor), permission predicates (conversation-lineage owner + view/control scopes, NO existence oracle), vendor-pattern vet, digest/update renderers (600B budget, never trips the 10240 wrap), panel schema validation. Gated by scripts/test-job-model.mjs (36).
  jobs.js — JobManager engine (2.342.0, docs/design-background-work.md): registry data/jobs.json + detached-wrapper spawns (identity pid+starttime+bootId, adopt-first boot, verified handle-kills, single-engine lock, park-after-6 crash loops, until-output cursor scan, cron ticks, GC-never-on-live, secret literal-redaction). Per-machine only (cross-machine parked by owner). 2.344.0: owner auto-notify (_notifyOwner at terminal/park/missed/ask/answered; toggles job>group>global default ON; 30s rate floor; stash data/job-notifications.json drained at resume injection; notifyPreview honesty). Gated by scripts/test-jobs-engine.mjs (27, real spawns).
  peer-messaging.js — THE delivery primitive for jobs→conversation notifications (2.344.0, B-0bf4): scans the CLI's own session registry (~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json + published <pid>.<sha>.key) and posts the documented two-frame injection (auth + stream-json user message) onto the session's cross-session-messaging inbox socket — the CLI queues mid-turn / opens a billed turn when idle / applies its own inbound controls (never bypassed; automation red line intact: we never write session stdin). Also postChannelEvent (experimental vibespace-channel lane). Local machine only; every failure returns {ok:false,reason} so the engine stashes. Gated by scripts/test-peer-messaging.mjs (10, real unix-socket inbox).
  otel-truth.js — PURE OTLP-logs parser (2.361.0, B-345b): the CLI's OpenTelemetry api_request events are the ONLY per-request channel that NAMES the billing org (transcript/statusline/rate_limit_event carry values, never identity). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  server/otel-ingest.js — loopback OTLP TRUTH receiver (2.361.0): local claude sessions push their own api_request telemetry here (zero vendor calls); observed org overrides link-intent attribution at ledger bake time + corrective attribution records + append-only stash. ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  usage-history.js — UsageHistory (2.61.0, codex 2.63.0): PERMANENT per-request token LEDGER for the Usage window. ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  session-status.js    — SessionStatusManager (session-level state/urgency set by the AGENT via vibespace-status CLI or by the user; user overrides of agent-set values record a pendingNotice injected as <system-reminder> into the NEXT chat-input; data/session-status.json — memory + session-status-updated broadcast are IMMEDIATE, disk write is DEBOUNCED 500ms + content-compared + flushed on exit (2.38.0), single-process so no race; independent of any task/context folder)
  user-todos.js — UserTodoManager (2.65.0, the GLOBAL user-facing TODO list / "For you" inbox): discrete items an AGENT filed that need the USER (decision/input/review) — the inverse of the agent's own TodoWrite. ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  task-groups.js — TaskGroupManager (岗位/Task-Group store; renamed from tasks.js in 2.39.0 — data/task-groups.json authoritative, migrated once from legacy data/tasks.json; ⊃ legacy groups, CRUD + bind/unbind + progress,… ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  webdav.js            — MountTokens (scoped bearer mount tokens, sha256-hashed, per-token chroot root + ro/rw) + registerWebdav (/dav WebDAV subset for VibeSpace↔VibeSpace mounting; auth = Bearer vsmt_ token, bypasses cookie auth, registered before json body parser)
  vnc.js — VncManager (2.104.0, in-container desktop): LAZY lifecycle — POST /api/vnc/start spawns Xtigervnc (-localhost -SecurityTypes None, safe: the cookie-authed /api/vnc WS bridge is the ONLY route in) + XF… ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  ssh-key-format.js — Private-key FORMAT classifier, PURE + shared server/browser (CJS pulled into the bundle like task-color-seq.js). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  ssh-key.js — Server-side private-key UNLOCK at import (2.246.0). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  ctx-sync.js — THE ctx-folder sync, ONE implementation for every machine (2.277.0). The old split — ssh=bidirectional rsync NO caps, dial=hashed sync with a SILENT ≤400-files/≤2MB cap — meant a 3MB context file reached every ssh host and never reached a dial device, invisibly. ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  discovery-facts.js — Shared discovery INTERPRETATION (2.278.0) — deliberately tiny so the esbuild agentd bundle carries it (unlike the ssh one-file scanner, the daemon CAN share code). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  writer-sweep.js — THE pre-resume writer sweep, ONE implementation for every machine (CS separation, 2.276.0). The invariant: before resuming, no OTHER process may still be writing that conversation's transcript (two writers on one JSONL = the B-4058 corruption class). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  remote-shell.js — ALSO buildRemoteExec (2.279.0): the five remote spawn command builders (ssh terminal/ssh keeper chat/ssh agentd pipe/dial pty/dial pipe) are ONE composition — `cd → pre → resolve → AMBIENT_OAT_UNS…` ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  **CS SEPARATION RULE (2.276.0): `hostId` is a PARAMETER, never a branch.** Server-side logic is written ONCE against a machine handle; the only difference between this machine, an ssh host and a dialed-in device is the transport underneath it. `hosts.device(falsy)` returns device #0 (the local daemon has been a full DeviceManager since 2.158.0 — same binary/mux/op surface — but was unreachable through the API, so every feature was written twice BY CONSTRUCTION). Migration table: docs/design-cs-unification.md — the metric is PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATIONS (9 twin-sets → 0 unjustified as of 2.279.1), not branch count (branches that select a transport for ONE shared implementation are fine). Live keystone proof: scripts/test-local-device.mjs (real daemon; absence THROWS). Documented exceptions require a table row + a drift/parity guard: the shipped single-file usage scanner (checkout-less host) and local file ops (SafeFs FUSE-hang isolation is load-bearing; the daemon carries live session pipes — revisit only with daemon-side worker isolation).
  hosts.js — HostManager (ssh host registry, connectivity test, keygen, remote discovery + first-user-message names, bootstrap, backend-status, dir-complete, fetchSessionJsonl = remote transcript → data/remote-jso… ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  remote-fs.js         — RemoteFs (ssh-per-op remote filesystem: list/read/write/mkdir/rename/rm/stat/copy/move/download/archive/tar-stream folder transfer — mirrors /api/file* shapes; files.js dispatches on ?host=, cross-host copy = server relay)
  auth.js              — Optional password auth (scrypt, server-side cookie tokens in data/auth.json, per-IP rate limit; VIBESPACE_PASSWORD / VIBESPACE_GENERATE_PASSWORD=1). 2.103.0: optional Clerk SSO rides on top — `passwordEnabled` vs `enabled` split (Clerk alone enables auth), POST /api/clerk-login verifies the Clerk session JWT vs JWKS and issues the SAME cookie token; loginHtml() renders password and/or SSO per config
  clerk-auth.js — ClerkAuth (2.103.0, env-gated: VIBESPACE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = on-switch, frontend-API host + JWKS URL DERIVED from the key's base64 payload; VIBESPACE_CLERK_ALLOWED_EMAILS comma list, @domain = whole domain, EMPTY = reject all). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md

  usage-routes.js — setupUsage() (2.92.0 split): the ENTIRE usage/rate-limit cluster from server.js — passive statusline ingest, read-only OAuth token, opt-in active poll, on-demand quota refresh, codex rollout-tail summarizer (§ban-safety rules apply — see kb-design-lessons §9). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  opslog.js — Optional persistent ops log (2.115.0, env-gated no-op): VIBESPACE_OPSLOG_DIR → console tee into daily-rotated files + boot/exit/crash markers (VIBESPACE_OPSLOG_CEPHFS_* = server kernel-mounts the path-scoped subtree first, same mechanism as My storage). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md
  incident.js — FREEZE THE SCENE for a panic-button capture (2.239.0, the admin's correction: users troubleshoot their own problems — ssh/resume/kill — and destroy the evidence before anyone looks). ⇒ kb-file-structure.md

## Key Design Decisions & Lessons Learned — INDEX

**Full text: docs/kb-design-lessons.md (moved verbatim; §-numbers unchanged). Read the relevant § BEFORE touching that area; update it in the same commit.**

- **§1 dtach for session persistence** — dtach NOT tmux (zero rendering layer); `dtach -c` never `-n`; NEVER delete socket files (the socket IS the session); pty-wrapper tees output to the buffer file.
- **§2 Mouse/scroll** — no middle layer; strip `\e[I`/`\e[O` focus events from onData; 6 tmux approaches failed (docs/history-archive.md).
- **§3 Ctrl+G external editor** — fake `code` script (GUI-editor whitelist trick) + HTTP bridge; never print to the terminal from the helper; POST carries the vsst_ Bearer.
- **§4 Session discovery** — LOCK-FIRST; claimJsonls exact→tail→mtime (mtime only over no-tail-evidence files); each lock claims ≤1 JSONL; status values tmux/external/stopped.
- **§5 Project path recovery** — cwd→dir encoding `replace(/[/._]/g,'-')` is deterministic; the reverse is ambiguous, prefer forward.
- **§6/6a/6b/6c Layout** — autosave/restore + gridBounds fractions; custom grid presets; MULTI-CLIENT sync anti-ping-pong (4 guards: seq, user-dirty w/ 60s expiry, defer-while-interacting, rounding epsilon — do not regress ANY); virtual desktops (visibility:hidden model, purge-vs-preserve on close).
- **§7/7a Modular frontend + mobile** — App mediator; isMobile/isTouch; long-press=contextmenu; mobile yield-sidebar is CENTRAL.
- **§8/8a/8b xterm + rendering** — WebGL renderer (do not remove), clearTextureAtlas on font change, alt-screen awareness, query-response arbitration, self-hosted fonts (never third-party origin); hljs span-split fix; 交付夜 invariants (self-update dialog, /dav DAV class 2, archive ops, VNC probe retry, mountpoint hygiene ladder).
- **§9 Usage / rate limits — §ban-safety home** — DEFAULT = passive statusline capture; active poll is OPT-IN (accounts.activeUsagePolling); read-only token NEVER refreshes; OAuth Bearer + anthropic-beta header; approach history in docs/history-archive.md.
- **§10 Settings** — schema-driven; only add settings with working code; serverSetting() server-side (never the SyncStore).
- **§11 Chat mode dual-arch** — THE big one: chat-wrapper stream-json, permission stdio protocol, subagent virtual sessions, workflow viewer, goal loop (claude native + codex thread/goal RPC), interrupt delayed-fallback, model/effort/permission mid-session switches, model lock v2, fallback policy, task wakeups. Read §11 in the kb before ANY chat-pipeline change.
- **§12 Font discovery** — queryLocalFonts → fc-list fallback; client fonts are what matter.
- **§13 StateSync** — versioned diff broadcast + reconnect resync; register stores before set() (writes silently drop otherwise).
- **§14 Syntax highlighting** — 30 langs, EXT_TO_LANG, splitHighlightedLines carries the span stack.
- **§15 Frontend optimization** — minify+gzip; delivery-stall watchdog; stale-tab reload is PER-TAB (sessionStorage); index.html route injects ?v=mtime cache-busting.
- **§16 i18n** — see Laws digest above + kb §16 for the full wrapping rules.
- **§17 UI design conventions** — see Laws digest above + kb §17 for the token/radius/type tables.
- **2026-06-09 review invariants (v2.8.0)** + **2026-07-03 review invariants** — two do-NOT-regress lists (escHtml quotes, atomic JSON writes, AbortController listeners, XSS rules, one-time WS handler self-guards…). In the kb.

## API Reference — INDEX

**Full REST + WebSocket reference: docs/kb-api.md (moved verbatim). Adding/changing a route or WS message type ⇒ update kb-api.md in the same commit.** Quick shape: REST under /api/* (files, sessions, usage, accounts, hosts, mounts, tasks, agent-facing vsst_ endpoints), WS /ws (create/attach/input/kill + msg/layout-sync/state-sync families), /dav WebDAV, /proxy.

## Features Summary — INDEX

**Full behavior reference: docs/kb-features.md (moved verbatim). These sections describe SHIPPED behavior with embedded do-not-regress notes — read the relevant one before changing that surface.**

- **Deployment & Onboarding** — auth (password/Clerk SSO), Docker/K8s/Helm, onboarding wizard, config export/import (4-touch-point gotcha), Manage Agents, account switching + billing identity + verdicts (the accounts mega-essay), chrome customization/springs/zones, toolbar scale, mounts/storage rows, remote hosts + keeper, orphan sweep, kill-path teardown, async discovery sweep.
- **Terminal Management** — dtach sessions, per-terminal settings, bell/idle detection, clipboard image paste, CJK, multi-device size, contrast.
- **Chat Mode** — message rendering, permission cards, relative-path linkify, metadata popup, virtual scroll, minimap, search, drafts, uploads, resume bar, read-only views.
- **Window Manager** — snap/grid/presets, shake-bypass, tab groups, move mode, virtual desktops, taskbar stacking, resume-all boot popup.
- **Session Management** — Task Groups (岗位) refactor + backlog claim model + status/urgency + injection contracts + repo task files + remote ctx sync + group admin + New-Session prefills + right-click menu + Session Properties + per-session config. The 2.39.0 concept-refactor block SUPERSEDES older bullets where they conflict.
- **File Management** — explorer, multi-select, clipboard ops, archives, viewers (PDF/DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/CSV/hex/eml), uploads, cross-host.
- **UI** — themes, theme editor, embedded browser + proxy normalization, window-list popup.

### claude CLI 中途文本丢失 (2026-07-13, 上游bug — 产品无辜, 勿再向内排查)
stream-json 下 assistant 的 `thinking→text→thinking→tool_use` 三明治形状响应, 其 text 块会在**长寿会话**中被 CLI 从 stdout 流和 JSONL 转录**双双丢弃**(模型上下文保留 → 永久分叉; 全新会话不复现, 连同形状都不复现; wrapper/normalizer/renderer 逐层验证无辜)。用户视角="agent 没回复"。取证档案+判别矩阵+issue草稿: ~/workspace/AIWorkspace/SharedContext/claude-cli-text-loss.md。Agent 准则: 实质内容只放 turn 末尾消息(其后无工具调用), 中途只发可丢弃状态行。

- **2.284.0 field-test batch invariants**: message-meta billing row is THREE-state honest (host-namespaced `h:<id>:` rid suffix-match / not-yet-harvested says so + session identity / no-requestId falls back to session-level — never a silently missing row); CLAUDE_KNOWN_MODELS = the GA baseline the dropdown always carries (passive discovery only learns locally-SERVED statusline models — Opus 5 was invisible until served here; noteModelSeen also feeds __models__.json from EVERY session's served model); customize-mode taskbar pill is BODY-FIXED measured off the live bar rect (a bar-child with negative offsets hides under extra rows when docked top); `.cz-overlay` dims with theme-agnostic black (a var(--bg) mix is invisible on dark themes — same class as the no-global-.hidden rule); #taskbar-row2 belongs in the pinned-defaults var block (extra rows are NEUTRAL zones — missing it made the same element size differently top vs bottom); extra rows re-dispatch contextmenu onto their parent bar. **2.284.1: per-message billing joins on message.id** — live stdout records carry NO requestId (CLI behavior; only the transcript copy has it), so the popup lookup queries rid AND mid; eventForMid joins mid-field/rid-fallback/host-namespaced; the remote scanner emits mid (parity-asserted per event). NO billing data is ever lost by a missing requestId — the ledger mines transcripts. Model baseline labels carry NO context-size claims (a claude-opus-5 session served 222k/1M under a "(200k)" label). **2.284.2: `api_retry` system records feed the SPINNER LABEL ("API retrying (3/10, HTTP 500)…"), deliberately card-less** — a fleet API-500 burst read as "everything stuck on thinking" because the subtype was silently dropped (the 2.227.5 invisible-record class again). **Degrade-gracefully catches can swallow their own bugs**: the 2.276.0 local writer sweep referenced shq out of scope and its own catch hid the ReferenceError for 6 releases — a degrade path that logs the message VERBATIM is the only reason it was ever found; never catch broader than the failure you designed for.

### Bug Fixes Applied — INDEX

**Full essays: docs/kb-bugfix-invariants.md (moved verbatim; ancient one-liners in docs/history-archive.md). Each entry is an incident whose FIX carries invariants — search here before re-diagnosing a familiar symptom.** Index:

- FOLD-DOMINATED TRIM WHITE-SCREEN (2.368.29, inc-mtajy6wr): 语义折叠让150条窗口矮于视口(sh=ch), trim掉的是唯一可见内容+每滚轮瞬移50条; 不变量=窗口矮于2视口必须生长不滑动(两个trim对称, cap升600)
- CREATOR NEVER GETS 'attached' — live state rides 'created' (2.368.4): resume的创建端历史走HTTP无meta, 只搭attach载荷的per-session状态(风格/auto-resume)永远到不了主流程; 加payload字段⇒枚举窗口诞生的每条路(create/attach/view/restart)逐一验证送达; 载荷进meta必须整体传递, 手抄键列表=第五次whitelist漂移
- HOSTED PAGE NEEDED A SECURE CONTEXT (2.366.1, owner '打开后无法加载'): crypto.randomUUID只在secure context存在, 而VibeSpace走明文http+主机名⇒undefined⇒画布每块artboard永远卡'Loading artboard…'; 127.0.0.1是可信源所以我在loopback上的验证全部无效(被owner一句'你用的是你发给我的链接访问的吗'戳破); 控制台两股报错(扩展postMessage 'null'/localStorage SecurityError)都是sandbox opaque origin的真实后果但都不是卡死原因; 修复=serve时compat prelude(randomUUID用getRandomValues补, 存储用内存版, 仅在缺失时装)+/p/<id>改shell(真origin, 无用户内容)框住/p/<id>/raw(仍sandbox); 不变量=托管产物必须在用户实际使用的地址上验证(loopback=secure context, 结论不可迁移), 浏览器测量必须带nonce(三次stale-tab假象带偏两个错误结论), 修复要用同源A/B(无补丁5/5卡, 有补丁0/5)证明
- SHARE URL GUESSED FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S BROWSER (2.366.1): 记住的'上次浏览器origin'被当作分享URL交给agent, 写进聊天回复的是本机主机名; 不变量=服务器不知道自己被怎样访问(反代/隧道), 绝对URL只能来自publicUrl或发问请求的Host, 给agent的一律是相对路径, 由前端按location.origin linkify
- CAPABILITY GATE READ THE WRONG FILE (2.364.1, owner三次Terminate+Resume无效): 2.361.1帧文件能力门从data/session-meta(服务器记录, 从无caps)读caps, 真caps在wrapper sidecar data/session-buffers/<id>.json → 所有wrapper都判'旧', 旁路死两版, >1MB粘贴全拒且拒收文案指错方向; 修复=wrapperCaps()唯一读者(sidecar+碰撞解析器, 无状态), 只缓存正向判定, 拒收带证据+进journal; 不变量=进程宣告的能力只从该进程写的文件读, 负判定不缓存, 拒收必须举证, 读者测试要对着真写者的文件+负控, 报告与解释矛盾时解释错…
- PROXIED POST EATEN BY BODY PARSER (2.363.2, inc-mt2bpw2f userW): express.json在unblocker之上吞掉代理POST的body→目标端等Content-Length到超时, GET无恙所以页面渲染正常但按钮全死; 修复=json parser跳过/proxy/(unblocker保持在auth之后, 严禁open proxy); 不变量=流式中间件必须拿到原始请求, 全局body parser与任何pass-through路由互斥…
- SEND REFUSAL READ AS ATTACH FAILURE (2.363.1, inc-mt2arppw userW): chat-input拒收被client当attach失败→活窗口翻Resume bar+拒收文本在error字段没人读; 修复=code:'input-rejected'分流+双字段+ring补记error; 不变量=一个error类型多语义必须带code分流…
